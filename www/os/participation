<h2>Improving the OpenSolaris project</h2>

<p>The OpenSolaris project will only be a successful open source project 
 if there is participation from a committed community. There are many 
 ways to participate in the OpenSolaris project, and this page describes 
 the primary ones that are currently available. Additional areas of 
 participation will spring up as the project grows and matures. </p>

<h3>Contributing Code</h3>
<p>Your first step in getting involved with software development for the 
 OpenSolaris project should be to join the <a href="/os/discussions/">
 Discussions</a> and <a href="/os/communities/">Communities</a> already
 taking place. After you get a sense for what work is being done by others 
 and a better idea of what you'd like to do, you can search the 
 <a href="http://bugs.opensolaris.org/">bug database</a> for bugs/RFEs 
 you want to work on and to see if someone else is already 
 working on an idea you've had.</p>

<p>Some &quot;bite-sized&quot; bugs have been identified by the Solaris engineers. 
 These bugs are small and self-contained, and we hope that they will be 
 interesting to work on. To find them, search for
<a href="http://bugs.opensolaris.org/bugdatabase/search.do?process=1&amp;category=&amp;subcategory=&amp;bugStatus=open&amp;type=&amp;keyword=oss-bite-size&amp;maxResults=10&amp;startIndex=1&amp;sortBy=relevance">oss-bite-size</a> 
 bugs.
</p>

<p>If you have an idea for a new feature, or have found a interesting bug, 
 you can file a bug/RFE using the &quot;Report a Bug&quot; form on 
 <a href="http://bugs.opensolaris.org/">http://bugs.opensolaris.org/</a>, 
 and others can work on the bug/RFE.  If you want to work on the bug/RFE 
 you thought of, send email to <b>request-sponsor AT opensolaris DOT
 org</b> describing the bug/RFE. A sponsor 
 will be assigned and will help you through the initial development processes.</p>

<p>Contribution information is available on the <a href="http://opensolaris.org/os/bug_reports/request_sponsor">request-sponsor table</a>.  Sun sponsors can watch this table to see what contributions are awaiting a sponsor.  And it's a good idea for contributors to check this table before starting work on a bug to see if someone has already submitted a fix for it.
  
</p><p>When it comes to actually contributing code -- from community members 
 inside and outside of Sun -- you must complete the following high-level 
 phases. The number of steps represented in these phases will vary 
 depending on the size and complexity of the change. </p>

<ul>
<li>Development/Implementation</li>
<li>Test</li>
<li>Review: code review (required), design and architectural review (if 
 needed)</li>
<li>Documentation changes (if needed)</li>
</ul>

<p>Please note that the OpenSolaris project is following the lead of other open source projects -- requiring contributors to jointly assign their copyright on contributed code. The Sun Contributor Agreement (SCA) gives Sun and the contributor joint copyright interests in the code: the contributor retains copyrights while also granting those rights to Sun as the open source project sponsor. The SCA is applicable to all products and projects owned or managed by Sun: signing it once means you can contribute code to any Sun-sponsored open source project. More detail, and the SCA itself, is available on the <a href="/os/about/sun_contributor_agreement/">Sun Contributor Agreement page</a>.</p>

<p>Refer to the <a href="/os/community/onnv/os_dev_process/">
 Initial Development Processes</a> document for detailed steps.</p>

<h3>Documentation</h3>

<p>The long term goal of Sun's Information Products department is to open 
 source its Solaris feature documentation.  In the interim, a 
 <a href="/os/community/documentation/"> Documentation community</a> has 
 been set up to broaden the involvement in this initiative.</p>

<ul>
<li>Join the conversation by subscribing to the OpenSolaris Documentation 
 discussion list.</li>
<li>Contribute comments to current Solaris documentation that you find on 
 docs.sun.com.  Your input will eventually be rolled into the open source 
 documents.</li>
<li>Work as a subject matter expert with current Solaris writers who will 
 document features, bug fixes and features that you contribute to OpenSolaris.</li>
</ul>

<p>In order to contribute to future OpenSolaris feature documentation, you 
 will need to work through a sponsor.  To obtain a sponsor, send a request 
 through the OpenSolaris documentation discussion.</p>

<h3>Testing</h3>
<p>Test development, frameworks, and execution are all important aspects 
 of high quality software engineering efforts. We've set up a 
 <a href="/os/community/opensolaris_test_qe/">Testing community</a> 
 devoted to discussing and planning initiatives such as:</p>

<ul>
<li>OpenSolaris Test Suites: Test suites and benchmarks used to test 
 the Solaris OS will be open sourced so they can be used by OpenSolaris 
 developers to test their code.</li>

<li>OpenSolaris Test Development: Test developers will be able to develop 
 selected OpenSolaris test suites and start new OpenSolaris test projects.</li>

<li>Self-Service Testing: A self-service regression and performance test 
 capability is being developed that will allow OpenSolaris developers to 
 submit test runs and review results.</li>

<li>Build / Test Farm: A build server and test machine farm where 
 OpenSolaris developers can build and test their code on a range of 
 platforms is planned.</li>

<li>Unit Test Repository: OpenSolaris developers will be able to submit 
 unit tests as part of the integration process. These unit tests will be 
 included in OpenSolaris test suites. </li>
</ul>
<p>Join the community to help define the test strategy and contribute 
 tests for the OpenSolaris project and code base.</p>
