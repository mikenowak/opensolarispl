        <p>When Sun released Solaris under an open-source license and began distributing the binary edition free of cost, millions of users downloaded it. Some estimates claims as many as 10 million downloads so far. As nice as Solaris is, though, users accustomed to Linux or FreeBSD found it lacking in several key areas: system management and other useful utilities, a friendly interface and dependency-resolving installers. The cries of "oh, if only Solaris had the GNU toolchain, a friendly installer, all those thousands of great Linux applications, Linux's great hardware support, and Debian's aptitude, it would be perfect."</p>

I took the Alpha 5 release out for a spin to see how well it's progressing. It might sound like an odd combination, but after more than a year of development, it actually works well, and is shaping up to be a very interesting operating system.</p>
