<p><strong><a name="whatis">What is the CDDL and why was it chosen for the
 OpenSolaris program?</a></strong></p>

<p>CDDL is the <a href="/os/licensing/opensolaris_license/">Common
 Development and Distribution License</a>.  It is an open source license 
 that takes the well-known Mozilla Public License (MPL) and makes it 
 reusable without modification.  We wanted a copyleft license that 
 provided open source protections and freedom and also enabled creation of larger works for commercial purposes.</p>

<p><strong><a name="OSI-approved">Has the CDDL been approved by the OSI?</a></strong></p>

<p>Yes.  The CDDL meets the requirements of the
 <a href="http://www.opensource.org/docs/definition.php">Open Source 
 Definition</a> and has been approved as an open source license by the 
 <a href="http://www.opensource.org/">Open Source Initiative</a>.</p>

<p><strong><a name="more-licenses">Why did you write another open source license?</a></strong></p>

<p>We reviewed a number of existing open source licenses but were unable 
 to find one that was appropriate for the OpenSolaris source code.  We 
 modified the license that most closely met our needs (MPL) and feel our
 changes made contributors' rights even clearer.  We designed the CDDL to 
 be reusable and attractive to other open source projects with similar 
 goals.</p>

<p><strong><a name="all-Solaris">Will all of the Solaris operating system be released under
 the CDDL?</a></strong></p>

<p>We plan to release as much of the source code as possible under the CDDL.
 Third-party open source used in the Solaris operating system will remain 
 available under its associated license(s).  For example, the version of 
 <a href="http://www.perl.org/">Perl</a> included in the OpenSolaris source 
 base is licensed under the <a href="http://www.opensource.org/licenses/artistic-license.php"> Perl Artistic License</a>.  And code that can not be made available as open source may
 be provided in binary form.  Refer to the <a href="/os/about/roadmap/">roadmap</a> for information about the planned
 availability of particular technology.</p>

<p><strong><a name="why-MPL">Why did you base the CDDL on the MPL?</a></strong></p>

<p>The MPL is a well-regarded license and had several attributes Sun was
 looking for, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>The requirement that the source of modifications be made available under
 the open source license;</li>
<li>The ability to distribute executables under a different license;</li>
<li>A "file-based" definition of modifications and covered software;</li>
<li>An explicit patent license.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong><a name="MPL-improvements">What improvements over the MPL did you make?</a></strong>

<p>In addition to retaining all desired features of the MPL (detailed
 above), the CDDL is designed to be reused by others and contains several 
 improvements to make it more general:</p>
<ul>
<li>Required notices were simplified;</li>
<li>The defnition of Modifications was clarified to make it easier for people to understand what is covered by the license and what is not;</li>
<li>Concerns about choice of law, venue and jurisdiction were addressed;</li>
<li>An option to make the Covered Software available under a specific version of the license was added.</li>
</ul>

<p>A <a href="http://www.sun.com/cddl/CDDL_why_summary.html">summary description</a>

 of the changes and the <a href="http://www.sun.com/cddl/CDDL_MPL_redline.pdf">redline diffs</a>
 (PDF) between the MPL 1.1 and the CDDL are provided.

<p><strong><a name="why-not-GPL">If you wanted a copyleft license, why didn't you just 
 use the GPL or LGPL?</a></strong></p>

<p>We needed an open source license that allowed files released under the
 license to be linked with files released under other licenses.  While a 
 license like LGPL would allow this for dynamically-linked code, we also 
 needed to be able to release software that statically links source files 
 available under different licenses.  In addition, we wanted to allow
 others to add externsions to OpenSolaris with different license terms.
 This was only possible under a license like the MPL; however, we could not
 use the MPL because it is not a "template" license allowing reuse by 
 others.  Consequently, we crafted a variant of the MPL, taking the
 opportunity to make it a template license as a step towards reducing
 license proliferation for others finding themselves in a similar
 position.

<p><strong><a name="patents">What does the CDDL say about patents?</a></strong>

<p>The CDDL provides an explicit patent license for code released under the
 license.  This means that you can use, modify, and redistribute code released 
 under CDDL without worrying about any patents that the contributors of the 
 code (including Sun) might have on the contributed technology.  The license 
 also includes a provision to discourage patent litigation against 
 developers by revoking the rights to the code for anyone initiating a 
 patent claim against a developer regarding code they have contributed.</p>

<p><strong><a name="CDDL-combo">Can code licensed under the CDDL be combined with code
 licensed under other open source licenses?</a></strong></p>

<p>CDDL is file-based.  That means files licensed under the CDDL can be
 combined with files licensed under other licenses, whether open source or 
 proprietary.  However, other licenses may have different restrictions which 
 may prevent such combination; it is your responsibility to read and
 recognize such restrictions.</p>

<p><strong><a name="dual-licensing">What about dual licensing? Can I license my code under the
 CDDL as well as another license?</a></strong></p>

<p>Yes, if you are the copyright owner for the code you can choose to license
 under multiple licenses, including the CDDL.</p>

<p><strong><a name="CDDL-proprietary">If I use code licensed under the CDDL in my proprietary 
 product, will I have to share my source code?</a></strong></p>

<p>Yes, for any source files that are licensed under the CDDL and any 
 modifications you make.  However, you don't need to share the source for 
 your proprietary source files.</p>

<p><strong><a name="license-req">If I contribute code to the OpenSolaris source base, what 
 will I be asked to do as far as licensing is concerned?</a></strong></p>

<p>Code contributed to the OpenSolaris source base must be made available 
 under the CDDL, and you must submit a signed
 <a href="/os/about/sun_contributor_agreement/">Contributor Agreement</a>. 
 Projects may have different contribution submission processes.  Contact
 the Project Leaders - listed on the project page - for specifics.</p>

<strong><a name="other-code-base">May I take portions of the OpenSolaris source code and use 
 it in another code base?</a></strong></p>

<p>Yes, you can use the OpenSolaris source code in other projects as long as 
 you comply with the terms of the CDDL.</p>

<p><strong><a name="redist">Can I redistribute or sell the OpenSolaris source code with my modifications?</a></strong></p>

<p>Yes, you can modify and redistribute code licensed under the CDDL, 
 including charging for it if you wish.  However, you will need to meet the 
 terms of the CDDL, including making the source of your modified code 
 available under the CDDL.</p>

<p><strong><a name="bin-commercial">May I use the OpenSolaris source code or binaries commercially?</a></strong></p>

<p>Yes, you may use the OpenSolaris source code in commercial products.  Note 
 that if you distribute binaries built from code released under the CDDL, you 
 will need to meet the terms of the CDDL and distribute the corresponding 
 source code under the CDDL.  See the <a href="/os/licensing/opensolaris_license/">license</a> for details.</p>

<p><strong><a name="CDDL-use">Can I use the CDDL for my project (unrelated to the OpenSolaris program)?</a></strong></p>

<p>Yes, the license is intended to be reusable by anyone.</p>

<p><strong><a name="no-source">Can Sun ever take away the OpenSolaris source code?</a></strong></p>

<p>No. The code is available to the community forever.</p>
