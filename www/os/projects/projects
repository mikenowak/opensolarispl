<!--
Introductory text

This text is expected to explain what a project is, and also how to
submit a proposal for consideration under the project approval process.
-->

<h2>OpenSolaris Projects</h2>

<p>
OpenSolaris projects are collaborative efforts that produce objects such
as code changes, documents, graphics, or collaboratively authored
products. Projects will have code repositories and committers and can
live within a <a href="/os/communities/">community</a> or independently.
</p>

<p>
The process for <b>requesting a new project</b> requires that a community
member write a proposal to the <code>opensolaris-discuss</code> list and
at least one other community member agree with the proposal. If the
proposal doesn't garner a seconder within 30 days, it will be considered
void. The process is intentionally lightweight because we expect that
the bulk of new collaborative efforts will be projects with many growing
into full communities comprised of one or more projects.
</p>
<p>
Once a project is approved, please see the <a href="/os/projects/posting_instr">posting instructions</a> for information about posting binaries and/or source on opensolaris.org.
</p>

                    <dd>
                        This project will create a virtual filesystem for Solaris to provide a CIFS/SMB client which can connect to Windows machines and Samba. We're porting code from the Darwin branch of NetBSD to do this.

                    <dd>
                        The Clearview project is an effort to unify the set of features implemented by various network interfaces on Solaris with the goal of simplifying the way that administrators and networking software handle those interfaces.

                    <dd>
                        This project -- which is similar to SFW Nevada -- is for the opening of the collection previously known as the Solaris Software Companion. This body of software consists of Free and Open Source software not supported by Sun; it installs into /opt/sfw and is delivered with Solaris 10 and previous releases as a "co-bundled" product (that is, it is not actually a part of Solaris and is not installed unless specifically requested).  This project will oversee the Nevada - and possibly longer-term - development of and addition to the software in the companion collection

                    <dd>
                        The Crossbow project (http://opensolaris.org/os/community/networking/crossbowpreso.pdf) is a network virtualization technology that greatly improves resource control, performance and network utilization needed to achieve true OS virtualization, utility computing and server consolidation. Crossbow will be the foundation for future innovation in network security  (DDOS, IDM, etc.), consolidated appliances, and end-to-end resource control.

                        This short-term project will implement RFC 3315 ("Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol for IPv6 (DHCPv6)") support in the existing Solaris dhcpagent.  Associated features (snoop, dhcpinfo, ifconfig) will be updated as well, and NDP RA interaction will be included.

                        The nfs4trace project introduces a new DTrace provider that instruments NFSv4 clients and servers.  The probes and their arguments represent the NFSv4 protocol.

                    <dd>
                         A major goal of this project is to improve the functionality of the LDAP NS backend to make it more approachable. Another goal of this project is to allow for the existence of multiple NS configurations in a system. This project will work closely with the NWAM[1] project, the SMF[2] community, the Sparks[3] project, and possibly the Visual Panels[4] project.

                    <dd>
                        This project maintains a software Ethernet bridge module for Solaris.  We hope to provide enough functionality to enable the creation of "stealth" (bridging) firewalls using IPFilter.  Some form of this project is expected to become a standard part of the OpenSolaris code eventually, at which time this project may choose to continue maintaining the ethbridge code for older Solaris systems.

                    <dd>
                        The Devname project builds the foundation for a simplified and flexible Solaris device naming model. The project implements an in-memory file system that exports the /dev namespace. This approach brings the flexibilities, on top of existing device naming framework,  needed in exporting a subset of the /dev namespaces, intercepting and resolving individual /dev name lookup request, and consolidating networked device naming across different hosts.

                    <dd>
                        FUSE is Filesystem in User Space. It provides a simple interface to allow implementation of a fully functional filesystem in userspace.  FUSE originates from the Linux community and is included in the Linux kernel (2.6.14+). This project is the porting of the freeBSD version of FUSE, http://fuse4bsd.creo.hu, to Solaris.

                    <dd>
                        IPsec Tunnel Reform addresses the last major shortcomings in the Solaris IPsec and IKE implementations. Tunnel Mode processing needs to be fully implemented AND be interoperable with other platforms, while at the same time not undermining Solaris design principles about tunnels.

                        The Java Desktop System is a secure and comprehensive enterprise desktop software solution that combines the best of open source innovation. Java Desktop System is a major component of the Solaris Operating System.  This project aims to collaborate on current development of the Solaris desktop and work to further innovation for future versions of the desktop.

                        This project will bring a set of generic interfaces for creating and managing public key objects (certificates, keys, policies) to Solaris.  It will deliver programming APIs, administrative utilities, and documentation to the ON consolidation.  The ultimate goal is to ease the burden of managing basic PKI objects for both administrators and developers.
