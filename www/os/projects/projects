<h2>OpenSolaris Projects</h2>

<p>
OpenSolaris projects are collaborative efforts that produce objects such
as code changes, documents, graphics, or collaboratively authored
products. Projects will have code repositories and committers and can
live within a <a href="/os/communities/">community</a> or independently.
</p>

<p>
The process for <b>requesting a new project</b> requires that a community
member write a proposal to the <code>opensolaris-discuss</code> list and
at least one other community member agree with the proposal. If the
proposal doesn't garner a seconder within 30 days, it will be considered
void. The process is intentionally lightweight because we expect that
the bulk of new collaborative efforts will be projects with many growing
into full communities comprised of one or more projects.
</p>

<p>
Once a project is approved, please see the <a href="/os/projects/posting_instr">posting instructions</a> for information about posting binaries and/or source on opensolaris.org.

                        This project -- which is similar to SFW Nevada -- is for the opening of the collection previously known as the Solaris Software Companion. This body of software consists of Free and Open Source software not supported by Sun; it installs into /opt/sfw and is delivered with Solaris 10 and previous releases as a "co-bundled" product (that is, it is not actually a part of Solaris and is not installed unless specifically requested).  This project will oversee the Nevada - and possibly longer-term - development of and addition to the software in the companion collection

The project implements an in-memory file system that exports the /dev namespace. This approach brings the flexibilities, on top of existing device naming framework,  needed in exporting a subset of the /dev namespaces, intercepting and resolving individual /dev name lookup request, and consolidating networked device naming across different hosts.

It combines tiny versions of many common UNIX utilities into a single small executable. It provides replacements for most of the utilities in GNU fileutils, shellutils, etc. The utilities in busybox often support fewer most frequently used options as compared to the feature rich GNU utilities. The reduction is done with size-optimization in mind.  This project aims at providing busybox equivalent for OpenSolaris. The current scope of the project is to comeout with 2 outputs:

* Shell integration of stand-alone commands in a modular manner. ksh93 will be the shell of choice for the same.

* All the identified commands housed in a stand alone executable.

                        This project provides Solaris with an iSCSI target with emulation of disks and SCSI pass through. iSCSI is a protocol which enables SCSI commands to be transported across the network using TCP/IP. The target will run on any Sun hardware (SPARC, AMD64, Intel) running Solaris Nevada.

                        The star integration/migration project is an effort to integrate the programs from the star project into OpenSolaris according to PSARC 2004/480. The first step is to add star to /usr/sfw, to replace /etc/rmt by rmt from the star package and to let ufsdump/ufsrestore use librmt from the star package.  The second step is to replace /usr/bin/tar by star.

It is particularly useful to engineers investigating the code path of individual library functions and system calls. The libMicro framework has been ported to many POSIX-like platforms, supports tests across multiple processes and threads, and provides many useful statistics. Its broad base of reference test cases is easily extended using the existing code as templates.
