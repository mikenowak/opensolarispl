	different from the process' effective uid.

file_owner
	Allows a process which is not the owner of a file or directory
	to perform the following operations that are normally permitted
	only for the file owner: modify that file's access and
	modification times; remove or rename a file or directory whose
	parent directory has the ``save text image after execution''
	(sticky) bit set; mount a ``namefs'' upon a file; modify
	permission bits or ACL except for the set-uid and set-gid
	bits.

file_setid

	a file without the set-user-ID and set-group-ID bits being
	cleared.

	Message Queue, Semaphore Set, or Shared Memory Segment whose

	and the effective uid of the current process is not 0.

net_icmpaccess
	Allows a process to send and receive ICMP packets.

net_privaddr
	Allows a process to bind to a privileged port
	number. The privilege port numbers are 1-1023 (the traditional
	UNIX privileged ports) as well as those ports marked as
	"udp/tcp_extra_priv_ports" with the exception of the ports
	reserved for use by NFS.

net_rawaccess
	Allows a process to have direct access to the network layer.

proc_clock_highres
	Allows a process to use high resolution timers.

proc_exec
	Allows a process to call execve().

proc_fork
	Allows a process to call fork1()/forkall()/vfork()

proc_info
	Allows a process to examine the status of processes other
	than those it can send signals to.  Processes which cannot
	be examined cannot be seen in /proc and appear not to exist.

proc_lock_memory
	Allows a process to lock pages in physical memory.

proc_owner
	Allows a process to send signals to other processes, inspect
	and modify process state to other processes regardless of
	ownership.  When modifying another process, additional
	restrictions apply:  the effective privilege set of the
	attaching process must be a superset of the target process'
	effective, permitted and inheritable sets; the limit set must
	be a superset of the target's limit set; if the target process
	has any uid set to 0 all privilege must be asserted unless the
	effective uid is 0.
	Allows a process to bind arbitrary processes to CPUs.

proc_priocntl
	Allows a process to elevate its priority above its current level.
	Allows a process to change its scheduling class to any scheduling class,
	including the RT class.

proc_session
	Allows a process to send signals or trace processes outside its
	session.

proc_setid
	Allows a process to set its uids at will.
	Assuming uid 0 requires all privileges to be asserted.

proc_taskid
	Allows a process to assign a new task ID to the calling process.

proc_zone
	Allows a process to trace or send signals to processes in
	other zones.

sys_acct
	Allows a process to enable and disable and manage accounting through
	acct(2), getacct(2), putacct(2) and wracct(2).

sys_admin

	as setting node and domain name and specifying nscd and coreadm
	settings.

sys_audit
	Allows a process to start the (kernel) audit daemon.
	Allows a process to view and set audit state (audit user ID,
	audit terminal ID, audit sessions ID, audit pre-selection mask).
	Allows a process to turn off and on auditing.
	Allows a process to configure the audit parameters (cache and
	queue sizes, event to class mappings, policy options).

sys_config
	Allows a process to perform various system configuration tasks.
	Allows a process to add and remove swap devices; when adding a swap
	device, a process must also have sufficient privileges to read from
	and write to the swap device.

sys_devices
	Allows a process to successfully call a kernel module that
	calls the kernel drv_priv(9F) function to check for allowed
	access.
	Allows a process to open the real console device directly.
	Allows a process to open devices that have been exclusively opened.

sys_ipc_config
	Allows a process to increase the size of a System V IPC Message
	Queue buffer.

sys_linkdir
	Allows a process to unlink and link directories.

sys_mount
	Allows filesystem specific administrative procedures, such as
	filesystem configuration ioctls, quota calls and creation/deletion
	of snapshots.
	Allows a process to mount and unmount filesystems which would
	otherwise be restricted (i.e., most filesystems except
	namefs).
	A process performing a mount operation needs to have
	appropriate access to the device being mounted (read-write for
	"rw" mounts, read for "ro" mounts).
	A process performing any of the aforementioned
	filesystem operations needs to have read/write/owner
	access to the mount point.
	Only regular files and directories can serve as mount points
	for processes which do not have all zone privileges asserted.
	Unless a process has all zone privileges, the mount(2)
	system call will force the "nosuid" and "restrict" options, the
	latter only for autofs mountpoints.
	Regardless of privileges, a process running in a non-global zone may
	only control mounts performed from within said zone.
	Outside the global zone, the "nodevices" option is always forced.

sys_net_config
	Allows a process to configure a system's network interfaces and routes.
	Allows a process to configure network parameters using ndd.
	Allows a process access to otherwise restricted information using ndd.
	Allows a process to push the rpcmod STREAMs module.
	Allows a process to pop anchored STREAMs modules.
	Allows a process to INSERT/REMOVE STREAMs modules on locations other
	than the top of the module stack.
	Allows a process to configure IPsec.

sys_nfs
	Allows a process to perform Sun private NFS specific system calls.
	Allows a process to bind to ports reserved by NFS: ports 2049 (nfs)
	and port 4045 (lockd).

sys_res_config
	Allows a process to create and delete processor sets, assign
	CPUs to processor sets and override the PSET_NOESCAPE property.
	Allows a process to change the operational status of CPUs in
	the system using p_online(2).
	Allows a process to configure resource pools and to bind
	processes to pools

sys_resource
	Allows a process to modify the resource limits specified
	by setrlimit(2) and setrctl(2) without restriction.
	Allows a process to exceed the per-user maximum number of
	processes.
	Allows a process to extend or create files on a filesystem that
	has less than minfree space in reserve.

sys_suser_compat
	Allows a process to successfully call a third party loadable module
	that calls the kernel suser() function to check for allowed access.
	This privilege exists only for third party loadable module
	compatibility and is not used by Solaris proper.

sys_time
	Allows a process to manipulate system time using any of the
	appropriate system calls: stime, adjtime, ntp_adjtime and
	the IA specific RTC calls.
