<p>Sun Patch Manager is one of the tools that is used to manage <span class="olink">
<span class="emphasis"><em>patches</em></span>
</span> on
Solaris systems.</p>
<div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Note</h3>

<p>For information about new tools for managing patches and updates
in this Solaris release, see <span class="olink">What's New in Software Management in the Solaris Operating System?</span>.</p>
</div>
<p>Patch Manager primarily operates on <span class="olink">
<span class="emphasis"><em>signed patches</em></span>
</span>,
which include a <span class="olink">
<span class="emphasis"><em>digital signature</em></span>
</span> from Sun Microsystems. A signed patch
offers greater security than an <span class="olink">
<span class="emphasis"><em>unsigned patch</em></span>
</span>,
which does not have a digital signature. The digital signature of the patch
is verified before the patch is applied to your system. A valid digital signature
ensures that the signed patch that you apply has not been modified since the
signature was applied. You can use the <span><strong class="command">smpatch add</strong></span> command
to apply unsigned patches. <a class="indexterm" name="indexterm-439"></a> <a class="indexterm" name="indexterm-440"></a> <a class="indexterm" name="indexterm-441"></a> <a class="indexterm" name="indexterm-442"></a> <a class="indexterm" name="indexterm-443"></a> <a class="indexterm" name="indexterm-444"></a>

<a class="indexterm" name="indexterm-445"></a>
<p>Patch Manager enables you to manually or automatically perform the <span class="emphasis"><em>patch management process</em></span>, which includes the following tasks:</p>
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li>
<p>Updating your system with some or all of the appropriate patches,
which automatically analyzes the system to determine the appropriate patches,
downloads the patches, and applies the patches to the system</p>
</li><li>
<p>Analyzing the system to obtain a list of appropriate patches</p>
</li><li>
<p>Downloading the appropriate patches to your system</p>
</li><li>
<p>Applying the appropriate patches to your system</p>
</li><li>
<p>Configuring the patch management environment for your system</p>
</li><li>
<p>Tuning the patch management environment for your system</p>
</li><li>
<p>Removing patches from your system</p>
</li></ul></div>

<div class="sect3" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="updatingsystem"></a>Automatically Updating Your System With
Patches</h4></div></div></div>

<a class="indexterm" name="indexterm-446"></a>
<a class="indexterm" name="indexterm-447"></a>
<a class="indexterm" name="indexterm-448"></a>
<a class="indexterm" name="indexterm-449"></a>
<p>Patch Manager can automatically apply the set of appropriate patches
to your system. An update performs these steps in the patch management process:</p>
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li>
<p>Analyzes your system to determine which patches are appropriate</p>
</li><li>
<p>Downloads those patches to your system</p>
</li><li>
<p>Applies only the patches that meet the policy for applying
patches</p>
</li></ul></div>
<p>After a patch has been successfully applied, the downloaded patch is
removed from the download directory.</p>
<p>Patches are applied to your system depending on the specified policy
and the patch properties associated with the patches that are downloaded.</p>
<p>If a patch does not meet the <span class="olink">
<span class="emphasis"><em>policy for applying patches</em></span>
</span>,
the patch is not applied. Instead, a patch entry for that patch is written
to the <code class="filename">disallowed_patch_list</code> file in the download directory.
Sun Patch Manager continues trying to apply the other patches. Later, you
can go to the download directory and use the <span><strong class="command">smpatch add</strong></span> command
to manually apply any disallowed patches that are listed in this file. For
any of the patches that have the <code class="literal">interactive</code> property set,
follow the instructions in the patch's README file to apply them.</p>
<p>For example, you can bring your system to single-user mode and apply
the patches listed in the <code class="filename">disallowed_patch_list</code> file
by typing the following:</p>
<pre class="screen"># <strong class="userinput"><code>smpatch add -x idlist=/var/sadm/spool/disallowed_patch_list</code></strong>
</pre>
<p>Instead of performing an <span class="olink">
<span class="emphasis"><em>update</em></span>
</span>, you can perform
the analyze, download, and apply tasks manually by using the <span><strong class="command">smpatch</strong></span> command.
These tasks are described in the following sections.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect3" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="analyzesystem"></a>Analyzing Your System</h4></div></div></div>

<a class="indexterm" name="indexterm-450"></a>
<a class="indexterm" name="indexterm-451"></a>
<p>Before you can apply patches to your system, you can determine which
patches are needed. You can use Patch Manager to perform a <span class="olink">
<span class="emphasis"><em>patch analysis</em></span>
</span> of
your system to obtain a list of appropriate patches.</p>
<p>Patch Manager uses analysis modules and a list of available patches
from the source of patches, which is the SunSolve Online web site by default,
to perform the analysis of your Solaris system. For information about the
source of patches, see <span class="olink">Specifying the Source of Patches</span>.</p>
<p>Based on the result of the analysis, the patches can be downloaded and
applied to your system.</p>
<p>Sometimes a patch depends on another patch, that is, the first patch
cannot be applied to the system until the other patch is applied. The first
patch is said to have a <span class="olink">
<span class="emphasis"><em>dependency</em></span>
</span> on
the second patch. When Patch Manager analyzes your system, it checks for patch
dependencies and automatically includes all patches in the resulting list.
If you request a system analysis based on particular patches, Patch Manager
adds any patches to the list that are needed to resolve patch dependencies.</p>
<div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Note</h3>

<p>The list of patches that is generated by the analysis is based
on all of the available patches from the Sun patch server. No explicit information
about your host system or its network configuration is transmitted to Sun.
Only a request for the Sun patch set is transmitted. The patch set is scanned
for patches that are appropriate for this host system, the results are displayed,
and those patches are optionally downloaded.</p>

<a class="indexterm" name="indexterm-453"></a>
<p>Before you apply patches to your system, you must <span class="olink">
<span class="emphasis"><em>download</em></span>
</span> the patches
that you want from the Sun patch server to that system.</p>
<p>You can download patches from the Sun patch server based on an analysis
of the system, or you can specify particular patches to download.</p>

<p>Patch Manager can <span class="olink">
<span class="emphasis"><em>apply</em></span>
</span> patches to your system.</p>
<p>If you use the <span><strong class="command">smpatch add</strong></span> command to apply particular
patches, it attempts to apply only those patches that you specified. The <span><strong class="command">smpatch add</strong></span> command does not attempt to resolve patch dependencies.
If you want to apply a patch that has a missing dependency, the patch is not
applied. You can use the <span><strong class="command">smpatch analyze</strong></span> command or the <span><strong class="command">smpatch update</strong></span> command to resolve patch dependencies.</p>

<p>You might want to remove (or <span class="olink">
<span class="emphasis"><em>back out</em></span>
</span>) a patch
that you previously applied to your system. Patch Manager enables you to remove
patches.</p>
<p>When you remove a patch, the Solaris patch tools restore all of the
files that have been modified by that patch, unless any of the following are
true:</p>
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li>
<p>The patch was applied by the <span><strong class="command">patchadd -d</strong></span> command,
which instructs <span><strong class="command">patchadd</strong></span> <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> to save
copies of files being updated or replaced.</p>
</li><li>
<p>The patch was applied by the <span><strong class="command">patchadd</strong></span> command
without using the <code class="option">
d</code> option and the backout files that were
generated have since been removed.</p>
</li><li>
<p>The patch has been <span class="olink">
<span class="emphasis"><em>obsoleted</em></span>
</span> by
a later patch.</p>
</li><li>
<p>The patch is required by another patch.</p>
</li></ul></div>
<p>The Solaris patch tools call the <span><strong class="command">pkgadd</strong></span> command to
restore <span class="olink">
<span class="emphasis"><em>packages</em></span>
</span> that were saved when the patch was initially applied.</p>
<p>During the patch removal process, the <span><strong class="command">patchrm</strong></span> command
logs the backout process in the <code class="filename">/tmp/backoutlog.</code>
<em class="replaceable"><code>process-id</code></em> file. This log file is automatically removed if the
patch is successfully removed.</p>
<p>Note that you can only
remove <span class="emphasis"><em>one</em></span> patch at a time when you use the <span><strong class="command">smpatch
remove</strong></span> command.</p>
<div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Note</h3>

<p>If you attempt to remove a patch on which other patches depend,
it is not removed. If you remove all of the patches that depend upon this
patch, then you can remove it.</p>

<p>When you use Patch Manager, your client systems must have access to
Solaris patches and patch data. Both client systems and local patch servers
can obtain patches from these sources:</p>
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li>
<p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Patch server &#8211;</strong></span> A
server that provides access to Solaris patches and patch data. <a class="indexterm" name="indexterm-464"></a> </p>
</li><li>
<p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Local collection of patches &#8211;</strong></span> A
collection of patches and patch data that is stored in a directory available
to the local system. Such a directory might be a local directory, a shared
network directory, or a CD mounted on your local system.</p>
</li></ul></div>
<p>The default source of patches for client systems is the Sun patch server.
As a result, any client system that obtains patches from the Sun patch server
must be connected, either directly or through a <span class="olink">
<span class="emphasis"><em>web proxy</em></span>
</span>, to
the Internet.</p>
<p>You can use a combination of different patch sources to configure these
patch management environments.</p>
<p>Clients access patches and patch data from the following sources:</p>
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li>
<p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Sun patch server &#8211;</strong></span> Your
client systems obtain patches from the Sun patch server.</p>
<p>This
configuration requires that your client systems are connected, directly or
through a web proxy, to the Internet.</p>
</li><li>
<p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Local collection of patches &#8211;</strong></span> Your
client systems obtain patches and patch data from a collection of patches
on your local system.</p>
<p>This configuration does not require that
the client systems be connected to the Internet.</p>
</li></ul></div>

<p>Patch Manager enables you to customize a policy for applying patches
to use when updating your system. The policy determines the types of patches
that can be applied during an update operation. <a class="indexterm" name="indexterm-468"></a>
</p>
<p>Solaris patches are classified as being standard or nonstandard. A <span class="olink">
<span class="emphasis"><em>standard
patch</em></span>
</span> can be applied to your Solaris system when running
in multiuser mode. A reboot is not required. Such a patch is associated with
the <code class="literal">standard</code> patch property. <a class="indexterm" name="indexterm-469"></a> <a class="indexterm" name="indexterm-470"></a> <a class="indexterm" name="indexterm-471"></a> <a class="indexterm" name="indexterm-472"></a>
</p>
<p>A <span class="olink">
<span class="emphasis"><em>nonstandard patch</em></span>
</span> has one of the following characteristics:</p>
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li>
<p>The patch is associated with one or more of the <code class="literal">rebootafter</code>, <code class="literal">rebootimmediate</code>, <code class="literal">reconfigafter</code>, <code class="literal">reconfigimmediate</code>, and <code class="literal">singleuser</code> properties.
Such a nonstandard patch can be applied during an update operation if permitted
by the policy.</p>
</li><li>
<p>The patch is associated with the <code class="literal">interactive</code> property.
Such a patch cannot be applied by using the <span><strong class="command">smpatch update</strong></span> command.
You can use the <span><strong class="command">smpatch add</strong></span> command or the <span><strong class="command">patchadd</strong></span> command
to apply such a patch.</p>
</li></ul></div>
<div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Note</h3>

<p>As of this Solaris release, not all Sun patches are available
through Sun Patch Manager. Such patches include those that do not conform
to PatchPro standards, and those that have third-party contract restrictions.</p>
