</indexterm>The Solaris Flash installation feature
enables you to use a single reference installation of the Solaris OS on a system,
which is called the master system. Then, you can replicate that installation on a
number of systems, which are called clone systems. You can replicate clone systems
with a Solaris Flash initial installation that overwrites all files on the system
or with a Solaris Flash update that only includes the differences between two
system images. A differential update changes only the files that are specified and
is restricted to systems that contain software consistent with the old master image.</para>

</indexterm>If you have a clone system and want to update that system, you can create
a differential archive that contains only the differences between two images, the
unchanged master image and an updated master image. When you update a clone system
with a differential archive, only the files that are in the differential archive are
changed. You can choose to install a Solaris Flash differential archive with
the custom JumpStart installation method or Solaris Live Upgrade. An update is a five-part
process.</para>
<orderedlist>
<listitem>
<para>Prepare the master system with changes. Before changes are made, the
master system should be running a duplicate of the original archive.</para>
<note>

<para>If the master system is not running a duplicate of the original archive,
the differences between the two system images might result in a large differential
archive. Consequently, installing the differential archive could be time consuming.
Use an initial installation with a full archive in this case.</para>

<olink remap="internal" targetdoc="chapter-1.xml" targetptr="flashoverview-fig-50">Figure 1–2</olink> shows the creation
and installation of a differential archive. A master image is updated with some modifications.
These modifications could be as simple as the addition, reconfiguration, or deletion
of a few files, or as complex as propagating patches. The updated master image is
compared to the unchanged master image. The differences between the two images become
the differential archive. The archive can be used to update other clone systems that
are currently using the unchanged master image. If the clone system has already been
modified or is not running the unchanged master image, the update fails. If you have
many changes to make on the clone systems, you can do an initial installation at any
time.</para>
