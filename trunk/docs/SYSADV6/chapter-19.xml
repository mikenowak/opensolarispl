<secondary>Kerberos and</secondary>
</indexterm>The <emphasis>Kerberos service</emphasis> is a client-server architecture
that provides secure transactions over networks. The service offers strong
user authentication, as well as integrity and privacy. <emphasis>Authentication</emphasis> guarantees
that the identities of both the sender and the recipient of a network transaction
are true. The service can also verify the validity of data being passed back
and forth (<emphasis>integrity</emphasis>) and encrypt the data during transmission
 (<emphasis>privacy</emphasis>).  Using the Kerberos service, you can log
in to other machines, execute commands, exchange data, and transfer files
securely. Additionally, the service provides <emphasis>authorization</emphasis> services,
which allows administrators to restrict access to services and machines. Moreover,
as a Kerberos user, you can regulate other people's access to your account. </para>
<para>
<indexterm xml:id="indexterm-2277">
<primary>single-sign-on system</primary>
<secondary>Kerberos and</secondary>
</indexterm>The Kerberos service is a <emphasis>single-sign-on</emphasis> system,
which means that you only need to authenticate yourself to the service once
per session, and all subsequent transactions during the session are automatically
secured. After the service has authenticated you, you do not need to authenticate
yourself every time you use a Kerberos-based command  such as <command>ftp</command> or <command>rsh</command>, or to access data on an NFS file system. Thus, you do not have
to send your password over the network, where it can be intercepted, each
time you use these services.</para>
<para>
<indexterm xml:id="indexterm-2278">
<primary>Kerberos</primary>
<secondary>Kerberos V5 protocol</secondary>
</indexterm>The Solaris Kerberos service is based on the Kerberos V5 network
authentication protocol that was developed at the Massachusetts Institute
of Technology (MIT). People who have used Kerberos V5 product should therefore
find the Solaris version very familiar. Because the Kerberos V5 protocol is
a <emphasis>de facto</emphasis> industry standard for network security, the
Solaris version promotes interoperability with other systems. In other words,
because the Solaris Kerberos service works with systems that use the Kerberos
V5 protocol, the service allows for secure transactions even over heterogeneous
networks. Moreover, the service provides authentication and security both
between domains and within a single domain. </para>
<para>The Kerberos service allows for flexibility in running Solaris applications.
You can configure the service to allow both Kerberos-based and non-Kerberos-based
requests for network services such as the NFS service, <command>telnet</command>,
and <command>ftp</command>. As a result, current Solaris applications still
work even if they are running on systems on which the Kerberos service is
not enabled. Of course, you can also configure the Kerberos service to allow
only Kerberos-based network requests.</para>
<para>
<indexterm xml:id="indexterm-2279">
<primary>GSS-API</primary>
<secondary>Kerberos and</secondary>
</indexterm>The Kerberos service provides a security mechanism which allows
the use of Kerberos for authentication, integrity, and privacy when using
applications that use the Generic Security Service Application Programming
Interface (GSS-API). However, applications do not have to remain committed
to the Kerberos service if other security mechanisms are developed. Because
the service is designed to integrate modularly into the GSS-API, applications
that use the GSS-API can utilize whichever security mechanism best suits their
needs.</para>

<para>The following is an overview of the Kerberos authentication system.
For a more detailed description, see <olink remap="external" targetdoc="chapter-25.xml" targetptr="refer-14">How the Kerberos
Authentication System Works</olink>.</para>
<para>From the user's standpoint, the Kerberos service is mostly invisible
after the Kerberos session has been started. Commands such as <command>rsh</command> or <command>ftp</command> work about the same. Initializing a Kerberos session often involves
no more than logging in and providing a Kerberos password.</para>

<secondary>definition in Kerberos</secondary>
</indexterm>The Kerberos system revolves around the concept of a <emphasis>ticket</emphasis>. A ticket is a set of electronic information that identifies a
user or a service such as the NFS service. Just as your driver's license identifies
you and indicates what driving privileges you have, so a ticket identifies
you and your network access privileges. When you perform a Kerberos-based
transaction (for example, if you remote log in to another machine), you transparently
send a request for a ticket to a <emphasis>Key Distribution Center</emphasis>,
or KDC. The KDC accesses a database to authenticate your identity and returns
a ticket that grants you permission to access the other machine. “Transparently”
means that you do not need to explicitly request a ticket. The request happens
as part of the <command>rlogin</command> command. Because only an authenticated
client can get a ticket for a specific service, another client cannot use <command>rlogin</command> under an assumed identity.</para>

</indexterm>Tickets have certain attributes associated with them. For example,
a ticket can be <emphasis>forwardable</emphasis>, which means that it can
be used on another machine without a new authentication process. A ticket
can also be <emphasis>postdated</emphasis>, which means that it is not valid
until a specified time. How tickets can be used, for example, to specify which
users are allowed to obtain which types of ticket, is set by <emphasis>policies</emphasis>.
Policies are determined when the Kerberos service is installed or administered.</para>

<secondary>or tickets</secondary>
</indexterm>You will frequently see the terms <emphasis>credential</emphasis> and <emphasis>ticket</emphasis>. In the greater Kerberos world, they are often used interchangeably.
Technically, however, a credential is a ticket plus the <emphasis>session
key</emphasis> for that session. This difference is explained in more detail
in <olink remap="external" targetdoc="chapter-25.xml" targetptr="refer-15">Gaining Access to a Service Using Kerberos</olink>.</para>

<para>Kerberos authentication has two phases: an initial authentication that
allows for all subsequent authentications, and the subsequent authentications
themselves.</para>
<para>The following figure shows how the initial authentication takes place.</para>

</figure>
<orderedlist>
<listitem>
<para>A client (a user, or a service such as NFS) begins a Kerberos
session by requesting a <emphasis>ticket-granting ticket</emphasis> (TGT)
from the Key Distribution Center (KDC). This request is often done automatically
at login. </para>
<para>A ticket-granting ticket is needed to obtain other
tickets for specific services. Think of the ticket-granting ticket as similar
to a passport. Like a passport, the ticket-granting ticket identifies you
and allows you to obtain numerous “visas,” where the “visas”
(tickets) are not for foreign countries but for remote machines or network
services. Like passports and visas, the ticket-granting ticket and the other
various tickets have limited lifetimes. The difference is that “Kerberized”
commands notice that you have a passport and obtain the visas for you. You
don't have to perform the transactions yourself. </para>
<para>Another analogy
for the ticket-granting ticket is that of a three-day ski pass that is good
at four different ski resorts. You show the pass at whichever resort you decide
to go to and you receive a lift ticket for that resort, as long as the pass
has not expired. Once you have the lift ticket, you can ski all you want at
that resort. If you go to another resort the next day, you once again show
your pass, and you get an additional lift ticket for the new resort. The difference
is that the Kerberos-based commands notice that you have the weekend ski pass,
and they get the lift ticket for you. So you don't have to perform the transactions
yourself.</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>The KDC creates a ticket–granting ticket and sends it
back, in encrypted form, to the client. The client decrypts the ticket-granting
ticket by using the client's password. </para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>Now in possession of a valid ticket-granting ticket, the client
can request tickets for all sorts of network operations, such as <command>rlogin</command> or <command>telnet</command>, for as long as the ticket-granting ticket lasts. This ticket
usually lasts for a few hours. Each time the client performs a unique network
operation, it requests a ticket for that operation from the KDC. </para>

<para>After the client has received the initial authentication, each subsequent
authentication follows the pattern that is shown in the following figure.</para>

<para>For example, suppose user <literal>joe</literal> wants to access an
NFS file system that has been shared with <literal>krb5</literal> authentication
required.  Because he is already authenticated (that is, he already has a
ticket-granting ticket), as he attempts to access the files, the NFS client
system automatically and transparently obtains a ticket from the KDC for the
NFS service.</para>
<para>For example, suppose the user <literal>joe</literal> uses <command>rlogin</command> on the server <literal>boston</literal>. Because he is already
authenticated, that is, he already has a ticket-granting ticket, he automatically
and transparently obtains a ticket as part of the <command>rlogin</command> command.
This ticket allows him to remote log in to <literal>boston</literal> as often
as he wants until the ticket expires. If <literal>joe</literal> wants to remote
log in to the machine <literal>denver</literal>, he obtains another ticket,
as in Step 1.</para>

<para>A client in the Kerberos service is identified by its <emphasis>principal</emphasis>.
A principal is a unique identity to which the KDC can assign tickets. A principal
can be a user, such as <literal>joe</literal>, or a service, such as <literal>nfs</literal> or <literal>telnet</literal>.</para>
<para>By convention, a principal name is divided into three components: the <emphasis>primary</emphasis>, the <emphasis>instance</emphasis>, and the <emphasis>realm</emphasis>.
A typical Kerberos principal would be, for example, <literal>joe/admin@ENG.EXAMPLE.COM</literal>. In this example:</para>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<para>
<literal>joe</literal> is the primary. The primary can be
a user name, as shown here, or a service, such as <literal>nfs</literal>.
The primary can also be the word <literal>host</literal>, which signifies
that this principal is a service principal that is set up to provide various
network services, <literal>ftp</literal>, <literal>rcp</literal>, <literal>rlogin</literal>, and so on.</para>

<literal>admin</literal> is the instance. An instance is optional
in the case of user principals, but it is required for service principals.
For example, if the user <literal>joe</literal> sometimes acts as a system
administrator, he can use <literal>joe/admin</literal> to distinguish himself
from his usual user identity. Likewise, if <literal>joe</literal> has accounts
on two different hosts, he can use two  principal names with different instances,
for example, <literal>joe/denver.example.com</literal> and <literal>joe/boston.example.com</literal>. Notice that the Kerberos service treats <literal>joe</literal> and <literal>joe/admin</literal> as two completely different principals.</para>
<para>In
the case of a service principal, the instance is the fully qualified host
name. <literal>bigmachine.eng.example.com</literal> is an example of such

to one another. Some realms are hierarchical, where one realm is a superset
of the other realm. Otherwise, the realms are nonhierarchical (or “direct”)
and the mapping between the two realms must be defined. A feature of the Kerberos
service is that it permits authentication across realms. Each realm only needs
to have a principal entry for the other realm in its KDC. This Kerberos feature
is called <emphasis>cross-realm authentication</emphasis>.</para>

<title>The Components of Various Kerberos Releases</title>
<para>Components of the Kerberos service have been included in many releases.
Originally, the Kerberos service and changes to the base operating system
to support the Kerberos service were released using the product name “Sun
Enterprise Authentication Mechanism” which was shortened to SEAM. As
more parts of the SEAM product were included in the Solaris software, the
contents of the SEAM release decreased. For the Solaris 10 release, all parts
of the SEAM product are included, so there is no longer a need for the SEAM
product. The SEAM product name exists in the documentation for historical
reasons. </para>

release. Each product release is listed in chronological order. All components

<para>Several new encryption types have been added to the Kerberos
service. These new encryption types increase security and enhance compatibility
with other Kerberos implementations that support these encryption types. See <olink remap="external" targetdoc="chapter-25.xml" targetptr="egric">Using Kerberos Encryption Types</olink> for more information.
The encryption types include:</para>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<para>The AES encryption type can be used for high speed, high security
encryption of Kerberos sessions. The use of AES is enabled through the Cryptographic
Framework. </para>

</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>The KDC software, the user commands, and user applications
now support the use of the TCP network protocol. This enhancement provides
more robust operation and better interoperability with other Kerberos implementations,
including Microsoft's Active Directory. The KDC now listens on both the traditional
UDP ports as well as TCP ports so it can respond to requests using either
protocol. The user commands and applications first try UDP when sending a
request to the KDC, and if that fails, then try TCP.</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>Support for IPv6 was added to the KDC software, which includes
the <command>kinit</command>, <command>klist</command> and <command>kprop</command> commands.
 Support for IPv6 addresses is provided by default. There are no configuration
parameters to change to enable IPv6 support. No IPv6 support is available
for the <command>kadmin</command> and <command>kadmind</command> commands.</para>
</listitem>

<para>A new <option>
e</option> option has been included to several
