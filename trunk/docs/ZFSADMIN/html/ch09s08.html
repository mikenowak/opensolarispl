<p>ZFS is designed to be robust and stable despite errors. Even so, software
bugs or certain unexpected pathologies might cause the system to panic when
a pool is accessed. As part of the boot process, each pool must be opened,
which means that such failures will cause a system to enter into a panic-reboot
loop. In order to recover from this situation, ZFS must be informed not to
look for any pools on startup.<a class="indexterm" name="indexterm-564"></a>

</p>
<p>ZFS maintains an internal cache of available pools and their configurations
in <code class="filename">/etc/zfs/zpool.cache</code>. The location and contents of
this file are private and are subject to change. If the system becomes unbootable,
boot to the <code class="literal">none</code> milestone by using the <code class="option">
m milestone=none</code> boot option. Once the system is up, remount your root file system
as writable and then remove <code class="filename">/etc/zfs/zpool.cache</code>. These
actions cause ZFS to forget that any pools exist on the system, preventing
it from trying to access the bad pool causing the problem. You can then proceed
to a normal system state by issuing the <span><strong class="command">svcadm milestone all</strong></span> command.
You can use a similar process when booting from an alternate root to perform
repairs.</p>
<p>Once the system is up, you can attempt to import the pool by using the <span><strong class="command">zpool import</strong></span> command. However, doing so will likely cause the same
error that occurred during boot, because the command uses the same mechanism
to access pools. If more than one pool is on the system and you want to import
a specific pool without accessing any other pools, you must re-initialize
the devices  in the damaged
pool, at which point you can safely import the good pool.</p>
