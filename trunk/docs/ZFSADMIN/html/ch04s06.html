<p>Occasionally, you might need to move a storage pool between machines.
To do so, the storage devices must be disconnected from the original machine
and reconnected to the destination machine. This task can be accomplished
by physically recabling the devices, or by using multiported devices such
as the devices on a SAN. ZFS enables you to export the pool from one machine
and import it on the destination machine, even if the machines are of different
endianness. For information about replicating or migrating file systems between
different storage pools, which might reside on different machines, see <span class="olink">Saving and Restoring ZFS Data</span>.<a class="indexterm" name="indexterm-178"></a>
<a class="indexterm" name="indexterm-179"></a>
</p>
<div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="gazre"></a>Preparing for ZFS Storage Pool Migration</h3></div></div></div>

<p>Storage pools should be explicitly exported to indicate that they are
ready to be migrated. This operation flushes any unwritten data to disk, writes
data to the disk indicating that the export was done, and removes all knowledge
of the pool from the system.</p>
<p>If you do not explicitly export the pool, but instead remove the disks
manually, you can still import the resulting pool on another system. However,
you might lose the last few seconds of data transactions, and the pool will
appear faulted on the original machine because the devices are no longer present.
By default, the destination machine refuses to import a pool that has not
been explicitly exported. This condition is necessary to prevent accidentally
importing an active pool that consists of network attached storage that is
still in use on another system.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="gazqr"></a>Exporting a ZFS Storage Pool</h3></div></div></div>

<p>To export a pool, use the <span><strong class="command">zpool export</strong></span> command. For
example:</p>
<pre class="screen"># <strong class="userinput"><code>zpool export tank</code></strong>
</pre>
<p>Once this command is executed, the pool <code class="literal">tank</code> is no
longer visible on the system. The command attempts to unmount any mounted
file systems within the pool before continuing. If any of the file systems
fail to unmount, you can forcefully unmount them by using the <code class="option">
f</code> option.
For example:</p>
<pre class="screen"># <strong class="userinput"><code>zpool export tank</code></strong>
cannot unmount '/export/home/eschrock': Device busy
# <strong class="userinput"><code>zpool export -f tank</code></strong>
</pre>
<p>If devices are unavailable at the time of export, the disks cannot be
specified as cleanly exported. If one of these devices is later attached to
a system without any of the working devices, it appears as &#8220;potentially
active.&#8221; If emulated volumes are in use in the pool, the pool cannot
be exported, even with the <code class="option">
f</code> option. To export a pool with
an emulated volume, first make sure that all consumers of the volume are no
longer active.<a class="indexterm" name="indexterm-180"></a>
<a class="indexterm" name="indexterm-181"></a>
<a class="indexterm" name="indexterm-182"></a>
</p>
<p>For more information about emulated volumes, see <span class="olink">Emulated Volumes</span>.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="gazru"></a>Determining Available Storage Pools to Import</h3></div></div></div>

<p>Once the pool has been removed from the system (either through export
or by forcefully removing the devices), attach the devices to the target system.
Although ZFS can handle some situations in which only a portion of the devices
is available, all devices within the pool must be moved between the systems.
The devices do not necessarily have to be attached under the same device name.
ZFS detects any moved or renamed devices, and adjusts the configuration appropriately.
To discover available pools, run the <span><strong class="command">zpool import</strong></span> command
with no options. For example:</p>
<pre class="screen"># <strong class="userinput"><code>zpool import</code></strong>
  pool: tank
    id: 3778921145927357706
 state: ONLINE
action: The pool can be imported using its name or numeric identifier.
config:

        tank        ONLINE
          mirror    ONLINE
            c1t0d0  ONLINE
            c1t1d0  ONLINE</pre>
<p>In this example, the pool <code class="literal">tank</code> is available to be
imported on the target system. Each pool is identified by a name as well as
a unique numeric identifier. If multiple pools available to import have the
same name, you can use the numeric identifier to distinguish between them.<a class="indexterm" name="indexterm-183"></a>
<a class="indexterm" name="indexterm-184"></a>
<a class="indexterm" name="indexterm-185"></a>
</p>
<p>Similar to the <span><strong class="command">zpool status</strong></span> command, the <span><strong class="command">zpool
import</strong></span> command refers to a knowledge article available on the web
with the most up-to-date information regarding repair procedures for this
problem. In this case, the user can force the pool to be imported. However,
importing a pool that is currently in use by another system over a storage
network can result in data corruption and panics as both systems attempt to
write to the same storage. If some devices in the pool are not available but
enough redundancy is available to have a usable pool, the pool appears in
the <code class="literal">DEGRADED</code> state. For example:</p>
<pre class="screen"># <strong class="userinput"><code>zpool import</code></strong>
  pool: tank
    id: 3778921145927357706
 state: DEGRADED
status: One or more devices are missing from the system.
action: The pool can be imported despite missing or damaged devices.  The
        fault tolerance of the pool may be compromised if imported.
   see: http://www.sun.com/msg/ZFS-8000-2Q
config:

        tank         DEGRADED
          mirror     DEGRADED
            c1t0d0   UNAVAIL   cannot open
            c1t1d0   ONLINE</pre>
<p>In this example, the first disk is damaged or missing, though you can
still import the pool because the mirrored data is still accessible. If too
many faulted or missing devices are present, the pool cannot be imported.
For example:</p>
<pre class="screen"># <strong class="userinput"><code>zpool import</code></strong>
  pool: dozer
    id: 12090808386336829175
 state: FAULTED
action: The pool cannot be imported. Attach the missing
        devices and try again.
   see: http://www.sun.com/msg/ZFS-8000-6X
config:
        raidz               FAULTED
          c1t0d0    ONLINE
          c1t1d0    FAULTED
          c1t2d0    ONLINE
          c1t3d0    FAULTED</pre>
<p>In this example, two disks are missing from a RAID-Z virtual device,
which means that sufficient replicated data is not available to reconstruct
the pool. In some cases, not enough devices are present to determine the complete
configuration. In this case, ZFS doesn't know what other devices were part
of the pool, though ZFS does report as much information as possible about
the situation. For example:</p>
<pre class="screen"># <strong class="userinput"><code>zpool import</code></strong>
pool: dozer
    id: 12090808386336829175
 state: FAULTED
status: One or more devices are missing from the system.
action: The pool cannot be imported. Attach the missing
        devices and try again.
   see: http://www.sun.com/msg/ZFS-8000-6X
config:
        dozer          FAULTED   missing device
          raidz       ONLINE
            c1t0d0    ONLINE
            c1t1d0    ONLINE
            c1t2d0    ONLINE
            c1t3d0    ONLINE
        Additional devices are known to be part of this pool, though their
        exact configuration cannot be determined.</pre>

<div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="gaztk"></a>Finding ZFS Storage Pools From Alternate Directories</h3></div></div></div>

<p>By default, the <span><strong class="command">zpool import</strong></span> command only searches
devices within the <code class="filename">/dev/dsk</code> directory. If devices exist
in another directory, or you are using pools backed by files, you must use
the <code class="option">
d</code> option to search different directories. For example:</p>
<pre class="screen"># <strong class="userinput"><code>zpool create dozer /file/a /file/b</code></strong>
# <strong class="userinput"><code>zpool export dozer</code></strong>
# <strong class="userinput"><code>zpool import</code></strong>
no pools available
# <strong class="userinput"><code>zpool import -d /file</code></strong>
  pool: dozer
    id: 672153753596386982
 state: ONLINE
action: The pool can be imported using its name or numeric identifier.
config:

        dozer       ONLINE
          /file/a   ONLINE
          /file/b   ONLINE
# <strong class="userinput"><code>zpool import -d /file dozer</code></strong>
</pre>
<p>If devices exist in multiple directories, you can specify multiple <code class="option">
d</code> options.<a class="indexterm" name="indexterm-186"></a>
<a class="indexterm" name="indexterm-187"></a>
<a class="indexterm" name="indexterm-188"></a>
</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="gazuf"></a>Importing ZFS Storage Pools</h3></div></div></div>

<p>Once a pool has been identified for import, you can import it by specifying
the name of the pool or its numeric identifier as an argument to the <span><strong class="command">zpool
import</strong></span> command. For example:</p>
<pre class="screen"># <strong class="userinput"><code>zpool import tank</code></strong>
</pre>
<p>If multiple available pools have the same name, you can specify which
pool to import using the numeric identifier. For example:</p>
<pre class="screen"># <strong class="userinput"><code>zpool import</code></strong>
  pool: dozer
    id: 2704475622193776801
 state: ONLINE
action: The pool can be imported using its name or numeric identifier.
config:

        dozer       ONLINE
          c1t9d0    ONLINE

  pool: dozer
    id: 6223921996155991199
 state: ONLINE
action: The pool can be imported using its name or numeric identifier.
config:

        dozer       ONLINE
          c1t8d0    ONLINE
# <strong class="userinput"><code>zpool import dozer</code></strong>
cannot import 'dozer': more than one matching pool
import by numeric ID instead
# <strong class="userinput"><code>zpool import 6223921996155991199</code></strong>
</pre>
<p>If the pool name conflicts with an existing pool name, you can import
the pool under a different name. For example:</p>
<pre class="screen"># <strong class="userinput"><code>zpool import dozer zeepool</code></strong>
</pre>
<p>This command imports the exported pool <code class="literal">dozer</code> using
the new name <code class="literal">zeepool</code>. If the pool was not cleanly exported,
ZFS requires the <code class="option">
f</code> flag to prevent users from accidentally
importing a pool that is still in use on another system. For example:</p>
<pre class="screen"># <strong class="userinput"><code>zpool import dozer</code></strong>
cannot import 'dozer': pool may be in use on another system
use '-f' to import anyway
# <strong class="userinput"><code>zpool import -f dozer</code></strong>
</pre>
<p>Pools can also be imported under an alternate root by using the <code class="option">
R</code> option.
For more information on alternate root pools, see <span class="olink">ZFS Alternate Root Pools</span>.<a class="indexterm" name="indexterm-189"></a>

<div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="gcfhw"></a>Recovering Destroyed ZFS Storage Pools</h3></div></div></div>

<p>You can use the <span><strong class="command">zpool import</strong></span> <code class="option">
D</code> command
to recover a storage pool that has been destroyed. For example:</p>
<pre class="screen"># <strong class="userinput"><code>zpool destroy tank</code></strong>

            c1t0d0  ONLINE
            c1t1d0  ONLINE</pre>
<p>In the above <span><strong class="command">zpool import</strong></span> output, you can identify
