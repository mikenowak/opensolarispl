</highlights><sect1 id="mipoverview-25"><title>Introduction to Mobile IP</title><para>Current versions of the Internet Protocol (IP) assume that the point at
which a computer attaches to the Internet or a network is fixed. IP also assumes that
the IP address of the computer identifies the network to which the computer is attached.
Datagrams that are sent to a computer are based on the location information that is
contained in the IP address. Many Internet Protocols require that a node's IP address
remain unchanged. If any of these protocols are active on a Mobile IP computing device,
their applications fail. Even HTTP would fail if not for the short-lived nature of
its TCP connections. Updating an IP address and refreshing the web page is not a burden.</para><para>If a mobile computer, or <emphasis>mobile node</emphasis>, moves to a
new network while its IP address is unchanged, the mobile node address does not reflect
the new point of attachment. Consequently, routing protocols that exist cannot route
datagrams to the mobile node correctly. You must reconfigure the mobile node with
a different IP address that represents the new location. Assigning a different IP
address is cumbersome. Thus, under the current Internet Protocol, if the mobile node
moves without changing its address, it loses routing. If the mobile node does change
its address, it loses connections.</para><para>Mobile IP solves this problem by allowing the mobile node to use two IP
addresses. The first address is a fixed <emphasis>home address</emphasis>. The second
address is a <emphasis>care-of address</emphasis> that changes at each new point of
attachment. Mobile IP enables a computer to roam freely on the Internet. Mobile IP
also enables a computer to roam freely on an organization's network while still maintaining
the same home address. Consequently, communication activities are not disrupted when
the user changes the computer's point of attachment. Instead, the network is updated
with the new location of the mobile node. See the <olink targetptr="glossary-1" remap="internal">Glossary</olink> for definitions of terms that are associated with Mobile IP.</para><para>The following figure illustrates the general Mobile IP topology. </para><figure id="mipoverview-fig-26"><title>Mobile IP Topology</title><mediaobject><imageobject><imagedata entityref="MIPtopology"/>

Then, the foreign agent can deliver every datagram that the mobile node sends to its
home agent. The home agent then forwards the datagram through the path that the datagram
would have taken had the mobile node resided on the home network. This process guarantees
that the source address is correct for all links that the datagram must traverse.</para>

</sect1><sect1 id="mipoverview-2"><title>How Mobile IP Works</title><para>Mobile IP enables routing of IP datagrams to mobile nodes. The home address
of the mobile node always identifies the mobile node regardless of where the mobile
node is attached. When away from home, a care-of address is associated with the mobile
node's home address. The care-of address provides information about the current point
of attachment of the mobile node. Mobile IP uses a registration mechanism to register
the care-of address with a home agent.</para><para>The home agent redirects datagrams from the home network to the care-of
address. The home agent constructs a new IP header that contains the care-of address
of the mobile node as the destination IP address. This new header encapsulates the
original IP datagram. Consequently, the home address of the mobile node has no effect
on the routing of the encapsulated datagram until the datagram arrives at the care-of
address. This type of encapsulation is called <emphasis>tunneling</emphasis>. After
the datagram arrives at the care-of address, the datagram is de-encapsulated. Then
the datagram is delivered to the mobile node.</para><para>The following figure shows a mobile node that resides on its home network,

a long-term address. However, the mobile node can only use the address while visiting
the subnet to which this care-of address belongs. When using a colocated care-of address,

</sect1><sect1 id="mipoverview-45"><title>Mobile IP With Reverse Tunneling</title><para>The section <olink targetptr="mipoverview-2" remap="internal">How Mobile IP Works</olink> assumes
that the routing within the Internet is independent of the source address of the datagram.
However, intermediate routers might check for a topologically correct source address.
If an intermediate router does check, the mobile node needs to set up a reverse tunnel.
By setting up a reverse tunnel from the care-of address to the home agent, you ensure
a topologically correct source address for the IP data packet. Reverse tunnel support
is advertised by foreign agents and home agents. A mobile node can request a reverse
tunnel between the foreign agent and the home agent when the mobile node registers.
A reverse tunnel is a tunnel that starts at the care-of address of the mobile node
and terminates at the home agent. The following figure shows the Mobile IP topology
that uses a reverse tunnel.</para><figure id="mipoverview-fig-36"><title>Mobile IP With a Reverse Tunnel</title><mediaobject><imageobject><imagedata entityref="ReverseTunnel"/>

Private addresses are not routeable through the Internet. When a mobile node has a
private address, the mobile node can only communicate with a correspondent node by
having its datagrams reverse-tunneled to its home agent. The home agent then delivers
the datagram to the correspondent node in whatever manner the datagram is normally
delivered when the mobile node is at home. The following figure shows a network topology

These services are likely to be equally valuable for mobile nodes that use Mobile

Thus, a mobile node can authenticate itself. Consequently, a mobile node can be authorized

The foreign agent adds all mobile nodes that are registered to the visitor table.
The foreign agent relays registration requests between mobile nodes and home agents.

datagrams for delivery to the mobile node. The foreign agent also sends periodic agent
advertisement messages to advertise the presence of the foreign agent.</para><para>If home agents and foreign agents support reverse tunnels, and the mobile node

packets to the foreign agent for delivery to the mobile node. A foreign agent that
supports reverse tunnels advertises that the reverse tunnel is supported for registration.
Because of the local policy, the foreign agent can deny a registration request when
the reverse tunnel flag is not set. The foreign agent can only distinguish multiple
mobile nodes with the same (private) IP address when these mobile nodes are visiting
different interfaces on the foreign agent. In the forward tunnel situation, the foreign
agent distinguishes between multiple mobile nodes that share the same private addresses
by looking at the incoming tunnel interface. The incoming tunnel interface maps to
a unique home agent address.</para>

request to the subnet-directed broadcast address of its home network. Each home agent

</sect2><sect2 id="mipoverview-21"><title>Broadcast Datagrams</title><para>When a home agent receives a broadcast datagram or multicast datagram, the home
agent only forwards the datagram to mobile nodes that have specifically requested
that they receive them. How the home agent forwards broadcast and multicast datagrams
to mobile nodes depends primarily on two factors. Either that mobile node is using
a foreign-agent provided care-of address, or the mobile node is using its own colocated
care-of address. The former means that the datagram must be double encapsulated. The
first IP header identifies the mobile node for which the datagram is to be delivered.
This first IP header is not present in the broadcast or multicast datagram. The second
IP header identifies the care-of address, and is the usual tunnel header. In the latter
instance, the mobile node is decapsulating its own datagrams, and the datagram needs
only to be sent through the regular tunnel.</para>

subnet, a mobile node can join a multicast group in any of the following ways:</para><itemizedlist><listitem><para>If the mobile node is using a colocated care-of address, the mobile node
can use this address as the source IP address of any Internet Group Management Protocol
(IGMP) join messages. However, a multicast router must be present on the visited subnet.</para>
</listitem><listitem><para>If the mobile node wants to join the ICMP group from its home subnet,
the mobile node must use a reverse tunnel to send IGMP join messages to the home agent.
However, the mobile node's home agent must be a multicast router. The home agent then
forwards multicast datagrams through the tunnel to the mobile node.</para>
</listitem><listitem><para>If the mobile node is using a colocated care-of address, the mobile

directly on the visited network.</para>

</itemizedlist><para>Multicast routing depends on the IP source address.  A mobile node that is sending
a multicast datagram must send the datagram from a valid source address on that link.
 So a mobile node that is sending multicast datagrams directly on the visited network
must use a colocated care-of address as the IP source address. Also, the mobile node
must have joined the multicast group that is associated with the address.  Similarly,
a mobile node that joined a multicast group while on its home subnet before roaming,
or joined the multicast group while roaming through a reverse tunnel to its home agent,
must use its home address as the IP source address of the multicast datagram. Thus,
the mobile node must have these datagrams reverse-tunneled to its home subnet as well,
either through itself by using its colocated care-of address, or through a foreign
agent reverse tunnel.</para><para>While it seems more efficient for a mobile node to always join from the
subnet that the mobile node is visiting, it is still a mobile node. Consequently,
the mobile node would have to repeat the join every time the mobile node switches
subnets. The more efficient way is for the mobile node to join through its home agent,
and not have to carry this overhead. Also, multicast sessions might be present that
are only available from the home subnet. Other considerations might also force the
 mobile node to participate in a specific way.</para>

</sect1><sect1 id="mipoverview-23"><title>Security Considerations for Mobile IP</title><para>In many situations, mobile computers use wireless links to connect to
the network. Wireless links are particularly vulnerable to passive eavesdropping,
active replay attacks, and other active attacks.</para><para>Because Mobile IP recognizes its inability to reduce or eliminate this vulnerability,
Mobile IP uses a form of authentication to protect Mobile IP registration messages
from these types of attack. The default algorithm that is used is MD5, with a key
size of 128 bits. The default operational mode requires that this 128-bit key precede
and succeed the data to be hashed. The foreign agent uses MD5 to support authentication.
The foreign agent also uses key sizes of 128 bits or greater, with manual key distribution.
Mobile IP can support more authentication algorithms, algorithm modes, key distribution
methods, and key sizes.</para><para>These methods do prevent Mobile IP registration messages from being altered.
However, Mobile IP also uses a form of replay protection to alert Mobile IP entities
when they receive duplicates of previous Mobile IP registration messages. If this
protection method were not used, the mobile node and its home agent might become unsynchronized
when either of them receives a registration message. Hence, Mobile IP updates its
state. For example, a home agent receives a duplicate deregistration message while
the mobile node is registered through a foreign agent. </para><para>Replay protection is ensured either by a method known as <emphasis>nonces,</emphasis> or <emphasis>timestamps</emphasis>. Nonces and timestamps are exchanged by home agents and mobile
nodes within the Mobile IP registration messages. Nonces and timestamps are protected
from change by an authentication mechanism. Consequently, if a home agent or mobile
node receives a duplicate message, the duplicate message can be thrown away.</para><para>The use of tunnels can be a significant vulnerability, especially if registration
is not authenticated. Also, the Address Resolution Protocol (ARP)  is not authenticated,
and can potentially be used to steal another host's traffic.</para><sect2 id="mipoverview-44"><title>Use of IPsec With Mobile IP</title><para>In general, because home agents and foreign agents are fixed entities, they
can use IPsec authentication or encryption to protect both Mobile IP registration
messages and forward and reverse tunnel traffic.  This process works completely independently
of Mobile IP, and only depends on the workstation's ability to perform IPsec functions.
Mobile nodes can also use IPsec authentication to protect their registration traffic.
If the mobile node registers through a foreign agent, in general the mobile node cannot
use IPsec encryption. The reason that the mobile node cannot use IPsec encryption
is because the foreign agent must be able to check the information in the registration
packet. While IPsec encryption could be used when a foreign agent is not needed, the
issue of colocation makes this difficult to achieve. IPsec is an IP-level security
relationship. Consequently, a home agent would have to know the mobile node's colocated
address without prior information or registration messages.  For more information
about IPsec, see <olink targetptr="ipsec-ov-1" remap="internal">Chapter&#160;19, IP Security Architecture (Overview)</olink> or <olink targetptr="ipsec-mgtasks-1" remap="internal">Chapter&#160;20, Configuring IPsec (Tasks)</olink>.</para>
