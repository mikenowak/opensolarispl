the IPsec policy for a host. When you run the command to configure the policy,
the system creates  the IPsec policy entries in the kernel. The system uses these entries to check
the policy on all outbound and inbound IP datagrams. Forwarded datagrams are
not subjected to policy checks that are added by using this command. The <command>ipsecconf</command> command also configures the security policy database (SPD).</para><itemizedlist><listitem><para>For information on how to protect forwarded packets, see the <olink targetdoc="refman1m" targetptr="ifconfig-1m" remap="external"><citerefentry><refentrytitle>ifconfig</refentrytitle><manvolnum>1M</manvolnum></citerefentry></olink> and <olink targetdoc="refman7" targetptr="lc-tun-7m" remap="external"><citerefentry><refentrytitle>tun</refentrytitle><manvolnum>7M</manvolnum></citerefentry></olink> man pages.</para>

</itemizedlist><para>You must become superuser or assume an equivalent role to invoke the <command>ipsecconf</command> command. The command accepts entries that protect traffic
in both directions. The command also accepts entries that protect traffic
in only one direction.</para><para>Policy entries with a format of local address and remote address can
protect traffic in both directions with a single policy entry. For example,
entries that contain the patterns <literal>laddr host1</literal> and <literal>raddr
host2</literal> protect traffic in both directions, if no direction is specified
for the named host. Thus, you need only one policy entry for each host.</para><para>Policy entries with a format of source address to destination address
protect traffic in only one direction. For example, a policy entry of the
pattern <literal>saddr host1 daddr host2</literal> protects inbound traffic
or outbound traffic, not both directions. Thus, to protect traffic in both
directions, you need to pass the <command>ipsecconf</command> command another
entry, as in <literal>saddr host2 daddr host1</literal>.</para><para>The <filename>ipsecpolicy.conf</filename> file is deleted
when the system shuts down. To ensure that the IPsec policy is active when
the machine boots, you can create an IPsec policy file, <filename>/etc/inet/ipsecinit.conf</filename>. This file is read when the network services are started. For
instructions on how to create an IPsec policy file, see <olink targetptr="ipsec-mgtasks-2" remap="internal">Protecting Traffic With IPsec (Task Map)</olink>.</para>

you create a configuration file to initialize IPsec with your specific IPsec
policy entries. You should name the file <filename>/etc/inet/ipsecinit.conf</filename>.
See the <olink targetdoc="refman1m" targetptr="ipsecconf-1m" remap="external"><citerefentry><refentrytitle>ipsecconf</refentrytitle><manvolnum>1M</manvolnum></citerefentry></olink> man

You can use the file as a template to create your own <filename>ipsecinit.conf</filename> file. The <filename>ipsecinit.sample</filename> file contains
the following examples:</para><screen>#
# For example,
#
#	 {rport 23} ipsec {encr_algs des encr_auth_algs md5}
#
# will protect the telnet traffic originating from the host with ESP using
# DES and MD5. Also:
#
#	 {raddr 10.5.5.0/24} ipsec {auth_algs any}
#
# will protect traffic to or from the 10.5.5.0 subnet with AH 
# using any available algorithm.
#
#
# To do basic filtering, a drop rule may be used. For example:
#
#    {lport 23 dir both} drop {}
# will disallow any remote system from telnetting in.
#
# If you are using IPv6, it may be useful to bypass neighbor discovery
# to allow in.iked to work properly with on-link neighbors. To do that,
# add the following lines:
#
#        {ulp ipv6-icmp type 133-137 dir both } pass { }
#
# This will allow neighbor discovery to work normally.</screen>

encryption algorithms to IPsec. You use the <command>ipsecalgs</command> command

covered by RFC 2407. In a general sense, a DOI defines data formats, network
traffic exchange types, and conventions for naming security-relevant information.
Security policies, cryptographic algorithms, and cryptographic modes are examples
of security-relevant information.</para><para>Specifically, the ISAKMP DOI defines the naming and numbering conventions
for the valid IPsec algorithms and for their protocols, <literal>PROTO_IPSEC_AH</literal> and <literal>PROTO_IPSEC_ESP</literal>. Each algorithm is  associated with exactly one
protocol. These ISAKMP DOI definitions are in the <filename>/etc/inet/ipsecalgs</filename> file.
The algorithm and protocol numbers are defined by the Internet Assigned Numbers
Authority (IANA). The <command>ipsecalgs</command> command makes the list
of algorithms for IPsec extensible.</para><para>For more information on the algorithms, refer to the <olink targetdoc="refman1m" targetptr="ipsecalgs-1m" remap="external"><citerefentry><refentrytitle>ipsecalgs</refentrytitle><manvolnum>1M</manvolnum></citerefentry></olink> man page.

Security associations (SAs) protect inbound packets and outbound packets.
The SADBs are maintained by a user process, or possibly multiple cooperating
processes, that send messages over a special kind of socket. This method of
maintaining SADBs is analogous to the method that is described in the <olink targetdoc="refman7" targetptr="route-7p" remap="external"><citerefentry><refentrytitle>route</refentrytitle><manvolnum>7P</manvolnum></citerefentry></olink> man page. Only superuser
