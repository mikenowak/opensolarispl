on a typical enterprise network. The following figure shows the network that
is referred to throughout the chapter. Your proposed IPv6 network might include
some or all of the network links that are illustrated in this figure.</para><figure id="ipv6-planning-fig-33"><title>IPv6 Network Topology Scenario</title><mediaobject><imageobject><imagedata entityref="ent-nw-IPv6-dep" width="100"/>

</figure><para>The enterprise network scenario consists of five subnets with existing
IPv4 addresses. The links of the network correspond directly to the administrative
subnets. The four internal networks are shown with RFC 1918-style private
IPv4 addresses, which is a common solution for the lack of IPv4 addresses.
The addressing scheme of these internal networks follows:</para><itemizedlist><listitem><para>Subnet 1 is the internal network backbone <literal>192.168.1</literal>.</para>

</listitem>
</itemizedlist><para>The external, public network <literal>172.16.85</literal> functions
as the corporation's DMZ. This network contains web servers, anonymous FTP
servers, and other resources that the enterprise offers to the outside world.
Router 2 runs a firewall and separates public network <literal>172.16.85</literal> from
the internal backbone. On the other end of the DMZ, Router 1 runs a firewall
and serves as the enterprise's boundary server. </para><para>In <olink targetptr="ipv6-planning-fig-33" remap="internal">Figure 4&#8211;1</olink>,
the public DMZ has the RFC 1918 private address <literal>172.16.85</literal>.
In the real world, the public DMZ must have a registered IPv4 address. Most
IPv4 sites use a combination of public addresses and RFC 1918 private addresses.
However, when you introduce IPv6, the concept of public addresses and private
addresses changes. Because IPv6 has a much larger address space, you use public
IPv6 addresses on both private networks and public networks.</para>
