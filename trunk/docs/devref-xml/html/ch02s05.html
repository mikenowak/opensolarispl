In order to use the source code management and build tools successfully,
you will need to set several environment variables correctly.  Most of
these variables are either <a href="apa.html#_workspace">workspace</a>-specific (see section 3.3.1) or
build-specific (see section 4.1).  However, in order to successfully use
the installed tools, you will need to set your PATH environment variable
correctly.  This should normally be done as part of your login scripts
so that it will be done automatically.
</p><p>
You can always get the latest information about recommend PATH
components from the gate's public/README file.  You can find a copy of
this file at
<a href="http://opensolaris.org/os/community/onnv/gate_info/README" target="_top">http://opensolaris.org/os/community/onnv/gate_info/README</a>.
</p><p>
PATH is used by your shell and other programs to determine where to find
programs.  This functionality has nothing to do with OpenSolaris, but in
order to find the various programs needed by the build tools, PATH
requires several elements in addition to the standard system
directories.  In general, these are:
</p><pre class="programlisting">
/opt/SUNWspro/bin
/opt/onbld/bin
/opt/onbld/`uname -p`/bin
</pre><p>
If you have installed your compilers or onbld tools in nonstandard
locations (which is not recommended), you will need to modify these
locations accordingly.  Also, you must be certain to include
/usr/ccs/bin in your PATH, and even more specifically, it must come
before /usr/ucb if that directory is included in your PATH.  As an
example of putting all this together, a working PATH might look like:
</p><pre class="programlisting">
$ echo $PATH
/usr/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/ccs/bin:/usr/dt/bin:/usr/openwin/bin: \
    /opt/onbld/bin:/opt/onbld/bin/sparc:/opt/sfw/bin:/usr/sfw/bin
</pre><p>
See the gate's public/README file for details.
</p><p>
Including /usr/ucb in your PATH is not recommended, and the build
process does not require any programs located there.  If you must
include it for some other reason, be sure it is the last component.
Otherwise, including /usr/ucb will cause your build to fail, especially
if it is before /usr/sbin.
</p><p>
Note that the paths to some tools are explicitly set in
usr/src/Makefile.master and other makefiles, so changing your PATH may
not by itself have the effect you intend.  Specifically, compiler paths
are fixed.  If you need to change this, you must override the make
macros specifying the compiler locations.  You can learn more about this
in section 4.1.
</p><p>
In addition to PATH, you may find it helpful to add /opt/onbld/man and
/opt/SUNWspro/man to your MANPATH.  This will make it easier to read the
manual pages associated with the many utilities discussed in this
document.  Alternately, you will need to add '-M /opt/onbld/man' or '-M
/opt/SUNWspro/man' to your invocation of man(1) in order to view these
pages.
