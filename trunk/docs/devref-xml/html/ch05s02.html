First, you must have a <a href="apa.html#_workspace">workspace</a> containing a built kernel.  If you
need more information on building kernels, see chapter 4 and especially
section 4.3.  Once you have built a kernel, you need to make an Install
tarball using the Install command.
</p><p>
The Install(1) utility creates a tar file that can be extracted into an
appropriate machine's root directory.  It utilizes an existing built
kernel tree and the kernel makefiles to determine the correct contents
of the tar file.  See Install(1) or the output of 'Install -h' for a
complete list of options; only the most commonly-used options are
described here.
</p><p>
The tar file constructed by Install is specific to an architecture, such
as sun4u or i86pc.  There are two ways to specify the architecture for
which you want Install to create an archive. The first is to be in the
architecture's subdirectory (usr/src/uts/&lt;arch&gt;) when running Install;
the second and preferred method is to use the -k &lt;arch&gt; option.  Note
that current releases of ON support only one architecture in each ISA:
sun4u on SPARC and i86pc on x86/amd64.
</p><p>
Another setting which is usually specified is the "glomname", using the
-G option.  This is the name of the subdirectory in /platform/&lt;arch&gt;/
that the binaries will go into, and is generally of the form
"kernel.something".  If you don't use a glomname, you will overwrite the
current kernel and modules on the target machine, and are likely to make
BFUing the machine later a more difficult task, as well as running the
risk of having to boot from alternate media to fix your machine if the
new kernel does not boot.
</p><p>
A simple invocation of Install might look like:
</p><pre class="programlisting">
$ Install -G kernel.foo -k sun4u
... lots of spew ...
Creating tarfile /tmp/Install.username/Install.sun4u.tar
Install complete
</pre><p>
You can now copy /tmp/Install.username/Install.sun4u.tar to your test
machine and extract it in the root directory.  It's best to use the '-o'
option when extracting so that file ownership will be correct.
</p><p>
On x86 with build 14 or newer, you will need to add your kernel to the
boot archive before you will be able to boot it.  To do this, add the
line:
</p><pre class="programlisting">
platform/i86pc/kernel.foo
</pre><p>
to <code class="code">/boot/solaris/filelist.ramdisk</code>, where <code class="code">kernel.foo</code> is the
glomname (the argument to <code class="code">-G</code>).  This requirement is eliminated in
build 18 and newer, and does not apply to SPARC.
</p><p>
After installing your kernel, reboot the test machine and have it use
the new kernel by running:
</p><pre class="programlisting">
(SPARC)
# reboot -- 'kernel.foo/sparcv9/unix'
</pre><pre class="programlisting">
(AMD64)
# reboot -- 'kernel.foo/amd64/unix'
</pre><pre class="programlisting">
(x86)
# reboot -- 'kernel.foo/unix'
</pre><p>
Note that you will need to use either this reboot syntax each time you
wish to boot the test kernel, or use similar arguments to the bootloader
or OBP.  Otherwise, the normal kernel installed by BFU or the regular
installation will be booted.
</p><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="_5_2_1_Caveats"></a>5.2.1 Caveats</h3></div></div></div><p>
Although Install is useful for developers who have changed only kernel
code, it is of limited value for others.  In particular, if a recent
flag day notice indicates that newer kernels are incompatible with
existing userland libraries or commands, Install cannot be used to test
the updated kernel until you have upgraded your userland via BFU or some
other mechanism such as the regular installation or upgrade procedure.
</p><p>
Like bfu (see section 5.3), Install is rather closely attached to its
particular release, so you should use the current version from the
<a href="apa.html#_gate">gate</a> matching the release you are building.  Normally this is in the
public/bin subdirectory of the gate; however, for installations outside
Sun it is located in /opt/onbld/bin.
</p><p>
It is critical that Install users install the correct set of
platform-specific modules, especially on SPARC systems.  Failure to do
so can result in an unbootable system.  See section 5.2.2 below for more
information on how platform-specific modules relate to Install.
</p><p>
One major advantage of Install over BFU is the ability to keep your
existing kernel in place so that you can still boot if the test kernel
proves toxic.  We strongly recommend that if you use Install to test
kernels, you take advantage of this feature and use distinct locations
(see the -G option described in section 5.2.1 above) for each new kernel
you test.  Otherwise, you will likely have to boot from alternate media
to repair your system following the installation of a bad kernel.

Ordinarily, Install does not generate archives with
implementation-specific modules.  If these archives are installed onto a
system which requires the missing modules, the system may fail to boot
or work properly.  If you do this, you will need to boot from a
known-working kernel and correct the problem.

An example symptom of the problem (on an Enterprise 3500):
</p><pre class="programlisting">

The console is gone!
</p><p>
To include the needed modules in your Install tarball, make sure to use
</p><pre class="programlisting">
$ Install -i &lt;implementation&gt;
</pre><p>
to include implementation-specific modules.  But how do you know what
sun4u implementation you need?  First, obtain your machine's "official"
implementation name from the output of 'uname -i'.  Then, in
usr/src/uts/sun4u, run "grep IMPLEMENTED_PLATFORM */Make*" to see a list
of implementations and the corresponding platform name reported by
uname(1).
</p><p>
In the example above, the E3500 reports:
</p><pre class="programlisting">
$ uname -i
SUNW,Ultra-Enterprise
</pre><p>
And we see from the grep output:
</p><pre class="programlisting">
$ grep IMPLEMENTED_PLATFORM */Make*
...
sunfire/Makefile:IMPLEMENTED_PLATFORM   = SUNW,Ultra-Enterprise
...
</pre><p>
In this case, the "-i sunfire" argument must be added to get the correct
behavior.
</p><p>
Additionally, one of the easiest ways to get tripped up with Install
wads comes from the fact that not all drivers are delivered by <a href="apa.html#_ON">ON</a>.
This has been particularly noticeable with x86, but it also happens with
SPARC, especially framebuffer drivers.  One way to work around this is
to do:
</p><pre class="programlisting">
# cd /platform/{sun4u,i86pc}
# mkdir glomname
# (cd kernel; tar cf - .) | (cd glomname; tar xf -)
</pre><p>
and then install the Install glom image.  This will copy your existing
drivers to the new kernel installation, ensuring that the drivers which
are not part of ON (or OpenSolaris as a whole) are available when you
reboot.
