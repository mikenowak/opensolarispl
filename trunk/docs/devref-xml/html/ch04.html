This chapter discusses two commonly-used ways to build OpenSolaris,
nightly(1)/bldenv(1) and make(1)/dmake(1).  The former provides a high
degree of automation and fine-grained control over each step in a full
or incremental build of the entire <a href="apa.html#_workspace">workspace</a>.  Using make(1) or
dmake(1) directly provides much less automation but allows you to build
individual components more quickly.  Section 4.1 is common to both
methods; 4.2 describes nightly(1) and bldenv(1), and 4.3 describes the
use of low-level make(1) targets.  Finally, section 4.4 describes what
results from a full build and how these intermediate products can be
used.  The instructions in this chapter apply to ON and similar
consolidations, including SFW and Network Storage (NWS).  Other
consolidations may have substantially different build procedures, which
should be incorporated here.

This section describes a few of the environment variables that affect
all ON builds, regardless of the build method.  See <a href="ch04s02.html">4.2 Using nightly and bldenv</a> for information on environment variables and files that
affect nightly(1) and bldenv(1).
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>CODEMGR_WS</p><p>
This variable is normally used by TeamWare (Sun's internal source code
management system).  Although a <a href="apa.html#_workspace">workspace</a> that does not use TeamWare
does not need this variable, you will occasionally see it referenced
when setting other variables.  It should be set to the root of your
workspace. It is highly recommended to use bldenv(1) to set this
variable as it will also set several other important variables at the
same time.  See section 1.3.3.2 for more information on bldenv(1).
</p></li><li><p>SRC</p><p>
This variable must be set to the root of the <a href="apa.html#_ON">ON</a> source tree within
your workspace; that is, ${CODEMGR_WS}/usr/src.  It is used by numerous
makefiles and by nightly(1).  This is only needed if you are building.
bldenv(1) will set this variable correctly for you.
</p></li><li><p>MACH</p><p>
The instruction set architecture of the machine as given by uname -p,
e.g.  sparc, i386.  This is only needed if you are building.  bldenv(1)
will set this variable correctly for you; it should not be changed.  If
you prefer, you can also set this variable in your dot-files, and use it
in defining PATH and any other variables you wish.  If you do set it
manually, be sure not to set it to anything other than the output of
'/usr/bin/uname -p' on the specific machine you are using:
</p><p>
Good:
</p><pre class="programlisting">
MACH=`/usr/bin/uname -p`
</pre><p>
Bad:
</p><pre class="programlisting">
MACH=sparc
</pre></li><li><p>ROOT</p><p>
Root of the proto area for the build.  The makefiles direct the
installation of header files and libraries to this area and direct
references to these files by builds of commands and other targets.  It
should be expressed in terms of $CODEMGR_WS.  See section 4.4.1 for more
information on the proto area.  If bldenv(1) is used, this variable will
be set to ${CODEMGR_WS}/proto/root_${MACH}.
</p></li><li><p>PARENT_ROOT</p><p>
PARENT_ROOT is the proto area of the parent workspace.  This can be used
to perform partial builds in children by referencing already-installed
files from the parent.  Setting this variable is optional.
</p></li><li><p>MAKEFLAGS</p><p>
This variable has nothing to do with OpenSolaris; however, in order for
the build to work properly, make(1) must have access to the contents of
the environment variables described in this section.  Therefore the
MAKEFLAGS environment variable should be set and contain at least "e".
bldenv(1) will set this variable for you; it is only needed if you are
building.  It is possible to dispense with this by using 'make -e' if
you are building using make(1) or dmake(1) directly, but use of
MAKEFLAGS is strongly recommended.
</p></li><li><p>SPRO_ROOT</p><p>
By default, it is expected that a working compiler installation exists
in <code class="code">/ws/onnv-tools/SUNWspro/SOS8</code> (this path is used internally at
Sun).  This variable can be set to override that location; since you
probably do not have compilers installed in the default location, you
will need to set this, normally to <code class="code">/opt/SUNWspro</code>.  You can see how
this works by looking at <code class="code">usr/src/Makefile.master</code>; if you need to
override the default, however, you should do so via the environment
variable.  Note that <code class="code">opensolaris.sh</code> has this variable already set to
this value.
</p></li><li><p>SPRO_VROOT</p><p>
The 'V' stands for version.  At Sun, multiple versions of the compilers
are installed under <code class="code">${SPRO_ROOT}</code> to support building older sources.
The compiler itself is expected to be in <code class="code">${SPRO_VROOT}/bin/cc</code>, so you
will most likely need to set this variable to <code class="code">/opt/SUNWspro</code>.  Note
that <code class="code">opensolaris.sh</code> has this variable already set to this value.
</p></li><li><p>GNU_ROOT</p><p>
The GNU C compiler is used by default to build the 64-bit kernel for
amd64 systems.  By default, if building on an x86 host, the build system
assumes there is a working amd64 gcc installation in <code class="code">/usr/sfw</code>.
Although it is not recommended, you can use a different gcc by setting
this variable to the gcc install root.  See <code class="code">usr/src/Makefile.master</code>
for more information.
</p></li><li><p>__GNUC, __GNUC64</p><p>
These variables control the use of gcc.  __GNUC controls the use of gcc
to build i386 and sparc (32-bit) binaries, while __GNUC64 controls the
use of gcc to build amd64 and sparcv9 (64-bit) binaries.  Setting these
variables to the empty value <span class="emphasis"><em>enables</em></span> the use of gcc to build the
corresponding binaries.  Setting them to <code class="code">'#'</code> enables Studio as the
primary compiler.  The default settings use Studio, with gcc invoked in
parallel as a 'shadow' compiler (to ensure that code remains warning and
error clean).
</p></li><li><p>CLOSED_IS_PRESENT</p><p>
This variable tells the ON makefiles whether to look for the closed
source tree.  Normally this is set automatically by nightly(1) and
bldenv(1).  See <a href="ch03s02.html#_3_2_8_Source_Files_not_Include">3.2.8 Source Files not Included</a> for more details.
