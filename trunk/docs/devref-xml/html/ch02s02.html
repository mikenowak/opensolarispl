The rest of this chapter discusses the software needed to build and
package OpenSolaris.  If you are only interested in looking at the
sources, editing them, and sending your patches to others, you can skip
this material; no special packages are required to view and edit the
sources.  We do recommend, however, that if you are installing Solaris
for the first time on a system you plan to use for
development, you install the "Entire" cluster (SUNWCall) because this
will save you a good deal of time if you later decide you want to build
OpenSolaris components.  Other distributions may offer different
installation options; consult your vendor's documentation.
</p><p>
We strongly recommend installing the "Entire" package cluster (SUNWCall)
on all development, build, and test systems.  Although systems with the
Developer (SUNWCdev) package cluster installed may work, this
configuration has not been tested and will not be evaluated or
recommended.  Additionally, you should obtain and install the SUNWonbld
package, which contains prebuilt versions of the tools in usr/src/tools
needed to build OpenSolaris components.  If you prefer, you can instead
use nightly(1) with the '-t' option to build these tools (see <a href="ch04s02.html">4.2 Using nightly and bldenv</a>) when building ON, but installing the package
is recommended to avoid dependency problems and is required for other
consolidations.  SUNWonbld can be downloaded from
<a href="http://opensolaris.org/os/downloads/on/" target="_top">http://opensolaris.org/os/downloads/on/</a>.  Finally, you will need to
obtain and install the Sun Studio compilers, dmake, and other tools.
You can obtain these tools from
<a href="http://opensolaris.org/os/community/tools/sun_studio_tools/" target="_top">http://opensolaris.org/os/community/tools/sun_studio_tools/</a>.
</p><p>
If you install and use a full installation (for example, Solaris or
Solaris Express CDs or DVDs), you will have a complete matching set of
programs, libraries, and kernel components.  However, if you later
upgrade the ON bits using a method such as BFU (see <a href="ch05s03.html">5.3 Using BFU to Install ON</a>) or Install (see <a href="ch05s02.html">5.2 Using Cap-Eye-Install to Install Kernels</a>), or want to build and copy in your own updated versions of a
few files, you may need to install newer versions of one or more system
packages first.  When this happens, it is known as a Flag Day.  You can
find more information about Flag Days in <a href="ch05.html#_5_1_3_Flag_Days_and_Other_Haza">5.1.3 Flag Days and Other Hazards</a>.
