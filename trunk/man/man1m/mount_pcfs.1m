.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
\fBmount\fR attaches an \fBMS-DOS\fR file system (\fBpcfs\fR) to the file system
hierarchy at the \fImount_point\fR, which is the pathname of a directory. If \fImount_point\fR has any contents prior to the \fBmount\fR operation, these are hidden until the file system is unmounted.
.LP
If \fBmount\fR is invoked with \fIspecial\fR or \fImount_point\fR as the only arguments, \fBmount\fR will search \fB/etc/vfstab\fR to fill in the missing arguments, including the \fIFSType-specific_options\fR; see \fBmount\fR(1M) for more details.
.LP
The \fIspecial\fR argument can be one of two special device file types:
.RS +4
.TP
.ie t \(bu
.el o
A floppy disk, such as \fB/dev/diskette0\fR or \fB/dev/diskette1\fR.
.RE
.RS +4
.TP
.ie t \(bu
.el o
A DOS logical drive on a hard disk expressed as \fIdevice-name\fR\fB:\fR\fIlogical-drive\fR , where \fIdevice-name\fR specifies the special block device-file for the whole disk and \fIlogical-drive\fR
is either a drive letter (c through z) or a drive number (1 through 24). Examples are \fB/dev/dsk/c0t0d0p0:\fR\fIc\fR and \fB/dev/dsk/c0t0d0p0:\fR\fI1\fR.
.RE
.LP
The \fIspecial\fR device file type must have a formatted \fBMS-DOS\fR file system with either a 12-bit, 16-bit, or 32-bit File Allocation Table.

Specify \fBpcfs\fR file system specific options. The following options are supported: 
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBfoldcase\fR|\fBnofoldcase\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 27n
.rt  
Force uppercase characters in filenames to lowercase when reading them from the filesystem. This is for compatibility with the previous behavior of \fBpcfs\fR. The default is \fBnofoldcase\fR.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBhidden\fR | \fBnohidden\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 27n
.rt  
Allow or disallow listing of files with hidden or system bits set. Option \fBhidden\fR is the default. When \fBnohidden\fR is effect, hidden and system files are neither visible
nor accessible. Note that PCFS in previous releases of the Solaris operating system used the \fBnohidden\fR option as the default.

\fB\fBclamptime\fR | \fBnoclamptime\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 27n
.rt  
File timestamps in \fBpcfs\fR cover a range between January 1st 1980 and December 31st 2127. This is not equal to the range of \fBtime_t\fR on Unix for either 32-bit or
64-bit applications. In particular, 32-bit applications fail with \fBEOVERFLOW\fR errors on the \fBstat\fR(2) system call when timestamps beyond the range of
32-bit \fBtime_t\fR are encountered. In order to prevent such spurious failures, \fBpcfs\fR by default clamps timestamps to the common subset of possible \fBpcfs\fR timestamps and the range available to 32-bit applications in Unix. The \fBclamptime\fR
mount option therefore is active by default. If you want access to the full range of possible timestamps on \fBpcfs\fR, mount the file system with the \fBnoclamptime\fR mount option. Note that if \fBnoclamptime\fR is used, only 64-bit applications will have access
to timestamps beyond January 19th 2038, 03:14:06 UTC; 32-bit applications will encounter \fBEOVERFLOW\fR errors.

.SH NOTES
.LP
If the directory on which a file system is to be mounted is a symbolic link, the file system is mounted on the directory to which the symbolic link refers, rather than on top of the symbolic link itself.
