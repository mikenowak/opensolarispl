<p>ZFS provides two levels of data redundancy in a mirrored and a RAID-Z
configuration.<a class="indexterm" name="indexterm-92"></a>

<div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="gamss"></a>Mirrored Storage Pool Configuration</h3></div></div></div>

<p>A mirrored storage pool configuration requires at least two disks, preferrably
on separate controllers. Many disks can be used in a mirrored configuration.
In addition, you can create more than one mirror in each pool. Conceptually,
a simple mirrored configuration would look similar to the following:<a class="indexterm" name="indexterm-93"></a>
<a class="indexterm" name="indexterm-94"></a>
<a class="indexterm" name="indexterm-95"></a>
<a class="indexterm" name="indexterm-96"></a>
</p>
<pre class="screen">mirror c1t0d0 c2t0d0</pre>
<p>Conceptually, a more complex mirrored configuration would look similar
to the following:</p>
<pre class="screen">mirror c1t0d0 c2t0d0 c3t0d0 mirror c4t0d0 c5t0d0 c6t0d0</pre>

<div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="gamtu"></a>RAID-Z Storage Pool Configuration</h3></div></div></div>

<p>In addition to a mirrored storage pool configuration, ZFS provides a
RAID-Z configuration. RAID-Z is similar to RAID-5.<a class="indexterm" name="indexterm-97"></a>
<a class="indexterm" name="indexterm-98"></a>
<a class="indexterm" name="indexterm-99"></a>
<a class="indexterm" name="indexterm-100"></a>
</p>
<p>All traditional RAID-5-like algorithms (RAID-4. RAID-5. RAID-6, RDP,
and EVEN-ODD, for example) suffer from a problem known as the &#8220;RAID-5
write hole.&#8221; If only part of a RAID-5 stripe is written, and power is
lost before all blocks have made it to disk, the parity will remain out of
sync with the data, and therefore useless, forever (unless a subsequent full-stripe
write overwrites it). In RAID-Z, ZFS uses variable-width RAID stripes so that
all writes are full-stripe writes. This design is only possible because ZFS
integrates file system and device management in such a way that the file system's
metadata has enough information about the underlying data replication model
to handle variable-width RAID stripes. RAID-Z is the world's first software-only
solution to the RAID-5 write hole.</p>
<p>You need at least two disks for a RAID-Z configuration. Otherwise, no
special hardware is required to create a RAID-Z configuration. Currently,
RAID-Z provides single parity. For example, if you have three disks in a RAID-Z
configuration, parity data occupies space equal to one of the three disks.</p>
<p>Conceptually, RAID-Z configuration with three disks would look similar
to the following:</p>
<pre class="screen">raidz c1t0d0 c2t0d0 c3t0d0</pre>
<p>A more complex conceptual RAID-Z configuration would look similar to
the following:</p>
<pre class="screen">raidz c1t0d0 c2t0d0 c3t0d0 c4t0d0 c5t0d0 c6t0d0 c7t0d0 raidz c8t0d0 c9t0d0 c10t0d0 c11t0d0 c12t0d0 c13t0d0 c14t0d0</pre>
<p>If you are creating a RAID-Z configuration with many disks, as in this
example, a RAID-Z configuration with 14 disks is better split into a two 7-disk
groupings. RAID-Z configurations with single-digit groupings of disks should
perform better.</p>

<div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="gazch"></a>Self-Healing Data in a Replicated Configuration</h3></div></div></div>

<p>ZFS provides for self-healing data in a mirrored or RAID-Z configuration.</p>
<p>When a bad data block is detected, not only does ZFS fetch the correct
data from another replicated copy, but it also repairs the bad data by replacing
it with the good copy.<a class="indexterm" name="indexterm-101"></a>
</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="gazdd"></a>Dynamic Striping in a Storage Pool</h3></div></div></div>

<p>For each virtual device that is added to the pool, ZFS dynamically stripes
data across all available devices. The decision about where to place data
is done at write time, so no fixed width stripes are created at allocation
time.<a class="indexterm" name="indexterm-102"></a>
<a class="indexterm" name="indexterm-103"></a>
<a class="indexterm" name="indexterm-104"></a>
</p>
<p>When virtual devices are added to a pool, ZFS gradually allocates data
to the new device in order to maintain performance and space allocation policies.
Each virtual device can also be a mirror or a RAID-Z device that contains
other disk devices or files. This configuration allows for flexibility in
controlling the fault characteristics of your pool. For example, you could
create the following configurations out of 4 disks:</p>
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li>
<p>Four disks using dynamic striping</p>
</li><li>
<p>One four-way RAID-Z configuration</p>
</li><li>
<p>Two two-way mirrors using dynamic striping</p>
</li></ul></div>
<p>While ZFS supports combining different types of virtual devices within
the same pool, this practice is not recommended. For example, you can create
a pool with a two-way mirror and a three-way RAID-Z configuration. However,
your fault tolerance is as good as your worst virtual device, RAID-Z in this
case. The recommended practice is to use top-level virtual devices of the
same type with the same replication level in each device.</p>
