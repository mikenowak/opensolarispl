<p>Unlike local disk set administration, you do not need to manually create
or delete disk set state databases. Solaris Volume Manager places one state database
replica (on slice 7) on each disk across all disks in the disk set, up to
a maximum of 50 total replicas in the disk set.</p>
<p>When you add disks to a disk set, Solaris Volume Manager automatically creates
the state database replicas on the disk set. When a disk is accepted into
a disk set, Solaris Volume Manager might repartition the disk so that the state database
replica for the disk set can be placed on the disk (see <span class="olink">Automatic Disk Partitioning</span>).</p>
<p>A file system that resides on a volume in a disk set normally is not
mounted automatically at boot time with the <code class="filename">/etc/vfstab</code> file.
The necessary Solaris Volume Manager RPC daemons (<code class="filename">rpc.metad</code> and <code class="filename">rpc.metamhd</code>) do not start early enough in the boot process to permit
this. Additionally, the ownership of a disk set is lost during a reboot. Do
not disable the Solaris Volume Manager RPC daemons in the <code class="filename">/etc/inetd.conf</code> file.
They are configured to start by default. These daemons must remain enabled
to allow Solaris Volume Manager to use its full functionality.</p>
<p>When the autotake feature is enabled using the <code class="option">
A</code> option
of the <span><strong class="command">metaset</strong></span> command, the disk set is automatically taken
at boot time. Under these circumstances, a file system that resides on a volume
in a disk set can be automatically mounted with the <code class="filename">/etc/vfstab</code> file.
To enable an automatic take during the boot process, the disk set must be
associated with only a single host, and must have the autotake feature enabled.
A disk set can be enabled either during or after disk set creation. For more
information on the autotake feature, see <span class="olink">Autotake Disk Sets</span>.</p>
<div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Note</h3>

<p>Although disk sets are supported in single-host configurations,
they are often not appropriate for &#8220;local&#8221; (not dual-connected)
use. Two common exceptions are the use of disk sets to provide a more manageable
namespace for logical volumes, and to more easily manage storage on a Storage
Area Network (SAN) fabric (see <span class="olink">Scenario&#8212;Disk Sets</span>.</p>
</div>
<p>Disk sets can be created and configured by using the Solaris Volume Manager command-line
interface (the <span><strong class="command">metaset</strong></span> command) or the Enhanced Storage tool within the Solaris Management Console.  </p>
<p>After disks are added to a disk set, the disk set can be <span class="emphasis"><em>reserved</em></span> (or <span class="emphasis"><em>taken</em></span>) and <span class="emphasis"><em>released</em></span> by
hosts in the disk set. When a disk set is reserved by a host, the other host
in the disk set cannot access the data on the disks in the disk set. To perform
maintenance on a disk set, a host must be the owner of the disk set or have
reserved the disk set. A host takes implicit ownership of the disk set by
putting the first disk into the set.</p>
<p>Disk sets, including disk sets created on a different system, can be
imported into existing Solaris Volume Manager configurations using the <span><strong class="command">metaimport</strong></span> command.</p>
<div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="eqbic"></a>Reserving a Disk Set</h3></div></div></div>

<a class="indexterm" name="indexterm-147"></a>
<a class="indexterm" name="indexterm-148"></a>
<p>Before a host can use the disks in a disk set, the host must reserve
the disk set. There are two methods of reserving a disk set: </p>
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li>
<p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Safely -</strong></span> When you safely
reserve a disk set, Solaris Volume Manager attempts to take the disk set, and the
other host attempts to release the disk set. The release (and therefore the
reservation) might fail. </p>
</li><li>
<p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Forcibly -</strong></span> When you forcibly
reserve a disk set, Solaris Volume Manager reserves the disk set whether or not another
host currently has the set reserved. This method is generally used when a
host in the disk set is down or not communicating. All disks within the disk
set are taken over. The state database is read in on the host performing the
reservation and the shared volumes configured in the disk set become accessible.
If the other host had the disk set reserved at this point, it would panic
due to reservation loss.</p>
<p>Normally, two hosts in a disk set cooperate
with each other to ensure that the disks in a disk set are reserved by only
one host at a time. A normal situation is defined as both hosts being up and
communicating with each other.</p>
</li></ul></div>
<div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Note</h3>

<p>If a disk has been determined unexpectedly not to be reserved
(perhaps because another host using the disk set forcibly took the disk),
the host will panic. This behavior helps to minimize data loss which would
occur if two hosts were to simultaneously access the same disk.</p>
</div>
<p>For more information about taking or reserving a disk set, see <span class="olink">How to Take a Disk Set</span>.</p>

<a class="indexterm" name="indexterm-149"></a>
<a class="indexterm" name="indexterm-150"></a>
<p>Releasing a disk set can be useful when you perform maintenance on the
physical disks in the disk set. When a disk set is released, it cannot be
accessed by the host. If both hosts in a disk set release the set, neither
host in the disk set can access the disks in the disk set.</p>
<p>For more information about releasing a disk set, see <span class="olink">How to Release a Disk Set</span>.</p>

<a class="indexterm" name="indexterm-153"></a>
<p>Beginning with the Solaris 9 9/04 release, the <span><strong class="command">metaimport</strong></span> command
enables you to import disk sets, including replicated disk sets, into existing
Solaris Volume Manager configurations that have device ID support in the disk
set. You can also use the <span><strong class="command">metaimport</strong></span> command to report
on disk sets that are available for import.</p>
<p>Replicated disk sets are created using remote replication software.
In order for a replicated disk set to be imported with the <span><strong class="command">metaimport</strong></span> command,
the slice containing the state database replica for each disk in the disk
set must also be replicated onto the same slice of the replicated disk set.
This corresponds to slice 7 for non-EFI disks and slice 6 for EFI disks. Before
replicating a disk set, make sure that the disk configurations of the data
to be replicated and of the remote site match. This step ensures that both
the state database replica and the data are replicated accurately.</p>
<p>The <span><strong class="command">metaimport</strong></span> command also does not import a disk
in a disk set if the disk does not contain a volume or a state database replica.
This scenario occurs if a volume or a state database replica have not been
added to a disk or have been deleted from a disk. In this case, when you import
the disk set to another system, you would find that the disk is missing from
the disk set. For example, maximum of 50 state database replicas are allowed
per Solaris Volume Manager disk set. If you have 60 disks in a disk set, the 10 disks
that do not contain a state database replica must contain a volume in order
to be imported with the disk set.</p>
<p>For tasks associated with importing a disk set, see <span class="olink">Importing Disk Sets</span>.</p>
<div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Note</h3>

<p>In a Sun Cluster environment, the <span><strong class="command">metaimport</strong></span> command

<p>When you add a new disk to a disk set, Solaris Volume Manager checks the disk
format. If necessary, Solaris Volume Manager repartitions the disk to ensure that the
disk has an appropriately configured slice 7 with adequate space for a state
database replica. The precise size of slice 7 depends on the disk geometry.
However, the size will be no less than 4 Mbytes, and probably closer to 6
Mbytes (depending on where the cylinder boundaries lie). </p>
<p>By default, Solaris Volume Manager places one state database replica on slice
7. You can increase the default size of slice 7 or decrease the size of the
state database replica in order to fit more than one state database replica
onto the slice.</p>
<div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Note</h3>

<p>The minimal size for slice 7 will likely change in the future,
based on a variety of factors, including the size of the state database replica
and information to be stored in the state database replica. The default size
for a state database replica in a multi-owner disk set is 16 Mbytes.</p>
</div>
<p>For use in disk sets, disks must have a slice 7 that meets these criteria:</p>
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li>
<p>Starts at sector 0</p>
</li><li>
<p>Includes enough space for a disk label and state database
replicas</p>
</li><li>
<p>Cannot be mounted</p>
</li><li>
<p>Does not overlap with any other slices, including slice 2</p>
</li></ul></div>
<p>If the existing partition table does not meet these criteria, Solaris Volume Manager repartitions
the disk. A small portion of each drive is reserved in slice 7 for use by Solaris Volume Manager.
The remainder of the space on each drive is placed into slice 0. Any existing
data on the disks is lost by repartitioning. </p>
<div class="tip" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Tip</h3>

<p>After you add a drive to a disk set, you may repartition it  as
necessary, with the exception that slice 7 is not altered in any way. </p>

<p>The output shows that the disk has been repartitioned to include a slice

<p>If you have disk sets that you upgraded from Solstice DiskSuite
software, the default state database replica size on those sets is 1034 blocks,
not the 8192 block size from Solaris Volume Manager. Also, slice 7 on the disks that
were added under Solstice DiskSuite software are correspondingly smaller than
slice 7 on disks that were added under Solaris Volume Manager. </p>
