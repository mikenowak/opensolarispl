<p>This section provides guidelines can assist you in creating mirrors. This section
also provides performance guidelines for the mirrors that you create.</p>
<div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="eyasp"></a>Configuration Guidelines for RAID-1 Volumes</h3></div></div></div>

<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li>
<p>Before you create a mirror, create the RAID-0 (stripe or concatenation)
volumes that comprise the mirror.</p>
</li><li>
<p>When creating a mirror, first create a one-way mirror, then attach
a second submirror. This strategy starts a resynchronization operation. This strategy
also ensures that data is not corrupted. You can also create a one-way mirror for
use as a future two-way or multi-way mirror.</p>
</li><li>
<p>You can create a two-way mirror, three-way mirror, or four-way mirror
from a one-way mirror with a single command. You can speed the creation process by
creating all submirrors with a single command. Use this process only if you are not
mirroring existing data and if you are comfortable destroying the data on all of the
submirrors.</p>
</li><li>
<p>You can create a RAID-1 volume from an existing file system that is
built on a slice. Only the single slice may be included in the primary RAID-0 volume
(submirror). If you are mirroring root or other system-critical file systems, all
submirrors must consist of only a single slice. </p>
</li><li>
<p>Use the <span><strong class="command">swap <code class="option">
l</code>
</strong></span> command to check
for all <code class="filename">swap</code> devices. Each slice that is specified as <code class="filename">swap</code> must be mirrored independently from the remaining swap slices.</p>
</li><li>
<p>The Enhanced Storage tool within the Solaris Management Console does not support unmirroring root (<code class="filename">/</code>), <code class="filename">/opt</code>, <code class="filename">/usr</code>, or <code class="filename">swap</code>. In fact,
the tool does not support unmirroring any file system that cannot be unmounted while
the system is running. Instead, use the command-line procedure for these file systems.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Use submirrors of the same size. Submirrors of different sizes result
in unused disk space.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Use only similarly configured submirrors within a mirror. In particular,
if you create a mirror with an unlabeled submirror, you cannot attach any submirrors
that contain disk labels. </p>
</li><li>
<p>You can have a mirrored file system in which the first submirror attached
does not start on cylinder 0.  All additional submirrors you attach must also not
start on cylinder 0. If you attempt to attach a submirror starting in this situation,
the following error message displays:        </p>
<pre class="screen">can't attach labeled submirror to an unlabeled mirror </pre>
<p>Either all submirrors intended for use within a specific mirror must start on
cylinder 0, or all of the submirrors must <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> start on cylinder
0. </p>
<p>Starting cylinders do not have to be the same across all submirrors.
However, all submirrors must either include or not include cylinder 0.</p>
</li><li>
<p>You can improve a mirror's performance by adding additional state
database replicas before you create the mirror. As a general rule, add two additional
replicas for each mirror you add to the system. Solaris Volume Manager uses these additional
replicas to store the dirty region log (DRL), which is used to provide optimized resynchronization.
By providing adequate numbers of replicas, you can minimize I/O impact on RAID-1 volume
performance. Using at least two replicas on the same disks or controllers as the mirror
that the replicas log also helps to improve overall performance.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Only mount the mirror device directly. Do not try to mount a submirror
directly, unless the submirror is offline and mounted read-only. Do not mount a slice
that is part of a submirror. This process could destroy data and crash the system.</p>
</li></ul></div>
</div>
<div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="eyasl"></a>Performance Guidelines for RAID-1 Volumes</h3></div></div></div>

<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li>
<p>Keep the slices of different submirrors on different disks and controllers.
Data protection is diminished considerably if slices of two or more submirrors of
the same mirror are on the same disk. Likewise, organize submirrors across separate
controllers, because controllers and associated cables tend to fail more often than
disks. This practice also improves mirror performance.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Use the same type of disks and controllers in a single mirror. Particularly
in old SCSI storage devices, different models or different brands of disks or controllers
can have widely varying performance. If disks and controller that have the different
performance levels are used in a single mirror, performance can degrade significantly.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Mirroring might improve read performance, but write performance is
always degraded. Mirroring improves read performance only in threaded or asynchronous
I/O situations.  A single thread reading from the volume does not provide a performance
gain.</p>
</li><li>
<p>You can experiment with the mirror read policies can improve performance.
For example, the default read mode is to alternate reads in a round-robin fashion
among the disks. This policy is the default because round-robin tends to work best
for UFS multiuser, multiprocessor activity.</p>
<p>In some cases, the <code class="literal">geometric</code> read option improves performance by minimizing head motion and
access time. This option is most effective when:</p>
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="circle"><li>
<p>There is only one slice per disk</p>
</li><li>
<p>Only one process at a time is using the slice or file system</p>
</li><li>
<p>I/O patterns are highly sequential or when all accesses are read</p>
</li></ul></div>
</li><li>
<p>You can attach a submirror to a mirror without interrupting service.
You attach submirrors to mirrors to create two-way, three-way, and four-way mirrors.</p>
</li><li>
<p>When you place a submirror offline, you prevent the mirror from reading
from and writing to the submirror. However, you preserve the submirror's logical association
to the mirror. While the submirror is offline, Solaris Volume Manager keeps track of all
writes to the mirror. The writes are written to the submirror when it is brought back
online. By performing an optimized resynchronization, Solaris Volume Manager only has to
resynchronize data that has changed, not the entire submirror. When you detach a submirror,
you sever its logical association to the mirror. Typically, you place a submirror
offline to perform maintenance. You detach a submirror to remove it.</p>

</td></tr><tr><td>
<p>Geometric</p>
</td><td>
<p>Enables reads to be divided among submirrors on the basis of a logical disk
block address. For example, with a two-way submirror, the disk space on the mirror
is divided into two equally-sized logical address ranges. Reads from one submirror
are restricted to one half of the logical range. Reads from the other submirror are
restricted to the other half. The geometric read policy effectively reduces the seek
time that is necessary for reads. The performance gained by this read policy depends
on the system I/O load and the access patterns of the applications.</p>

<p>The pass number, a number in the range 0&#8211;9, determines the order in which
a particular mirror is resynchronized during a system reboot. The default pass number
is 1. The lower pass numbers are resynchronized first. If zero is used, the mirror
resynchronization is skipped. A pass number of zero should be used only for mirrors
that are mounted as read-only. Mirrors with the same pass number are resynchronized
at the same time.</p>

<p>The <span><strong class="command">metastat</strong></span> command of Solaris Volume Manager reports status information
on RAID 1 volumes and submirrors. The status information helps you to determine if
maintenance action is required on a RAID-1 volume. The following table explains submirror
states shown when you run the metastat command on a RAID-1 volume.</p>
<div class="table"><a name="fpkae"></a><p class="title"><b>Table 10.3. Submirror

</div>
<p>Additionally, for each slice in a submirror, the <span><strong class="command">metastat</strong></span> command
shows the following:</p>
<div class="variablelist"><dl><dt><span class="term">Device</span></dt><dd>
<p>Indicates the device name of the slice in the stripe</p>

</dd><dt><span class="term">Hot Spare</span></dt><dd>
<p>Indicates that a slice is being used as a hot spare for a failed slice</p>
</dd></dl></div>
<p>The submirror state only provides general information on the status of the submirror.
The slice state is perhaps the most important information to review when you are troubleshooting
mirror errors. If the submirror reports a &#8220;Needs Maintenance&#8221; state, you
must refer to the slice state for more information.</p>
<p>You take a different recovery action depending on if the slice is in the &#8220;Maintenance&#8221;
state or in the &#8220;Last Erred&#8221; state. If you only have slices in the &#8220;Maintenance&#8221;
state, they can be repaired in any order. If you have slices both in the &#8220;Maintenance&#8221;
state and in the &#8220;Last Erred&#8221; state, you must fix the slices in the &#8220;Maintenance&#8221;
state first. Once the slices in the &#8220;Maintenance&#8221; state have been fixed,
then fix the slices in the &#8220;Last Erred&#8221; state. For more information, see <span class="olink">Overview of Replacing and Enabling Components in RAID-1 and RAID-5 Volumes</span>.</p>
