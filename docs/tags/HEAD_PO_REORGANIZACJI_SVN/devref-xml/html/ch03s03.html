This section describes how to perform common operations on your
<a href="apa.html#_workspace">workspace</a>, such as editing files and modifying the build system.
</p><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="_3_3_1_Getting_Ready_to_Work"></a>3.3.1 Getting Ready to Work</h3></div></div></div><p>
Once you have brought over a <a href="apa.html#_workspace">workspace</a>, you must set up both the
workspace itself and your environment before you can safely use it.
</p><p>
First, you must set your environment variables appropriately so that the
build tools will work properly.  This must be done once in any shell
which will run commands that affect the workspace.  Although there are
numerous variables which must be set, nearly all of them are set by
bldenv(1), which accepts a nightly-style environment file.  For example,
if your workspace's environment file is in /aux0/testws/opensolaris.sh,
you would need to run the following command in each shell from which you
will run commands that affect the workspace:
</p><pre class="programlisting">
$ bldenv /aux0/testws/opensolaris.sh
</pre><p>
It may be tempting to run this command from your shell initialization
scripts; however, if you have more than one workspace, it can be
inconvenient and even dangerous, as you may inadvertently perform an
operation on the wrong workspace.
</p></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="_3_3_2_Editing_Files"></a>3.3.2 Editing Files</h3></div></div></div><p>
You can use any text editor you like to edit source files.  Although
choice of editor is a personal matter, not all editors are equal.  In
particular, there are two types of editor behavior which are certain to
cause problems.  First, some editors such as pico and nano wrap lines
longer than 72 characters or so.  While this is fine for documents, it
causes havoc in source files.  If you must use such an editor, be sure
to turn off line wrapping; otherwise your diffs will include large
quantities of noise and the resulting file may not compile.  Second,
some editors, especially on non-Unix systems which may have different
conventions, will change newline characters from '\n' to something else.
If you must edit sources on a foreign system, be absolutely certain your
editor outputs Unix-style newlines.  Source files containing foreign
newline characters cannot be integrated into any OpenSolaris
consolidation and may not compile.
</p><p>
When you edit source files, be sure that you are familiar with the style
guide; see section 7.2 for more details.  Once again, not all editors
are equal: some may offer the ability to set parameters that will help
you to write conformant code, while others may enforce fixed settings
which conflict with our style.  Regardless of your choice of editor, you
will need to be sure that your code conforms to the style guidelines.
</p></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="_3_3_3_Modifying_the_ON_Build_S"></a>3.3.3 Modifying the ON Build System</h3></div></div></div><p>
This section provides detailed, step-by-step instructions for common
build-related tasks, such as adding or moving kernel modules and adding
new libraries.  You should also read the sections regarding makefile
layout and operation to gain a better understanding of the overall build
system.
</p><div class="sect3" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="_3_3_3_1_Adding_a_New_Kernel_Mo"></a>3.3.3.1 Adding a New Kernel Module</h4></div></div></div><p>
The most common build-related operation developers need to perform is
adding a new kernel module to the <a href="apa.html#_gate">gate</a>.  In this section, we describe
the process of adding build instructions for foofs, whose sources are
located under usr/src/uts/common/fs/foofs.  Adding related commands and
libraries (in usr/src/cmd and usr/src/lib) is not covered here.
</p><p>
0) Create the usr/src/uts/common/fs/foofs directory and populate it with
your sources.
</p><p>
1) Edit uts/*/Makefiles.files to define the set of objects. By
convention the symbolic name of this set is of the form MODULE_OBJS,
where MODULE is the module name (foofs). The files in each subtree
should be defined in the Makefile.files in the root directory of that
subtree. Note that they are defined using the += operator, so that the
set can be accumulated across multiple makefiles. As example:
</p><pre class="programlisting">
FOOFS_OBJS +=	foovfs.o foovno.o
</pre><p>
Each source file needs a build rule in the corresponding Makefile.rules
file (compilation and linting). A typical pair of entries would be:
</p><pre class="programlisting">
$(OBJS_DIR)/%.o:		$(UTSBASE)/common/fs/foofs/%.c
	$(COMPILE.c) -o $@ $&lt;
	$(CTFCONVERT_O)
</pre><pre class="programlisting">
$(LINTS_DIR)/%.ln:		$(UTSBASE)/common/fs/foofs/%.c
	@($(LHEAD) $(LINT.c) $&lt; $(LTAIL))
</pre><p>
In this case, these are added to usr/src/uts/common/Makefile.rules.  If
the module being added is architecture-specific, they must instead be
added to the appropriate architecture-specific Makefile.rules file.  See
section 3.2.3 for more information about specific makefiles.
</p><p>
2) Create build directories in the appropriate places. If the module can
be built in a platform-independent way, this would be in the
"instruction set architecture" directory (i.e.: sparc, intel). If not,
these directories would be created for all appropriate "implementation
architecture"-dependent directories (i.e.: sun4u).  In this case, foofs
is common code, so two build directories are needed:
usr/src/uts/sparc/foofs and usr/src/uts/intel/foofs.
</p><p>
3) In each build directory, create a makefile. This can usually be
accomplished by copying a Makefile from a parallel directory and editing
the following lines (in addition to comments).
</p><pre class="programlisting">
MODULE		= foofs
OBJECTS		= $(FOOFS_OBJS:%=$(OBJS_DIR)/%)
LINTS		= $(FOOFS_OBJS:%.o=$(LINTS_DIR)/%.ln)
ROOTMODULE	= $(ROOT_FS_DIR)/$(MODULE)
</pre><p>
- replace directory part with the appropriate installation directory
name (see Makefile.uts)
</p><p>
If a custom version of modstubs.o is needed to check the undefineds for
this routine, the following lines need to appear in the makefile (after
the inclusion of Makefile.plat (i.e.: Makefile.sun4u)).
</p><pre class="programlisting">
MODSTUBS_DIR	 = $(OBJS_DIR)
$(MODSTUBS_O)	:= AS_CPPFLAGS += -DFOOFS_MODULE
</pre><p>
- replace "-DFOOFS_MODULE" with the appropriate flag for the modstubs.o
assembly.
</p><pre class="programlisting">
CLEANFILES	+= $(MODSTUBS_O)
</pre><p>
4) Edit the parent Makefile.mach (i.e.: Makefile.sparc, Makefile.intel)
to know about the new module:
</p><pre class="programlisting">
FS_KMODS	+= foofs
</pre><p>
Note that if your module only applies to a subset of the supported
architectures, you will only need to perform this step for the makefiles
that are used for those architectures.
</p><p>
Any additional questions can be easily answered by looking at the many
existing examples or by using the mailing lists and fora at
<a href="http://opensolaris.org/" target="_top">http://opensolaris.org/</a>.
</p></div><div class="sect3" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="_3_3_3_2_Making_a_Kernel_Module"></a>3.3.3.2 Making a Kernel Module Architecture-Independent</h4></div></div></div><p>
In some cases, a module which was specific to a particular
implementation architecture is adapted to be more general, often
because the hardware it supports has become available on more
platforms.  Once the module itself is able to be used across multiple
platforms, its build parameters should be updated to reflect this.
Its location in the source tree will also need to change.
</p><p>
0) Create the build directory under the appropriate "instruction
set architecture" build directory (i.e.: sparc/MODULE).
</p><p>
1) Move the makefile from the "implementation architecture" build
directory (i.e.: sun4u/MODULE) to the directory created above.
Edit this makefile to reflect the change of parent (trivial:
comments, paths and includes).
</p><p>
2) Edit the "implementation architecture" directory makefile
(i.e.: Makefile.sun4u) to *not* know about this module and
edit the "instruction set architecture" directory makefile
(i.e.: Makefile.sparc) to know about it.
</p><p>
3) Since the install locations may have changed (as well as the
set of systems on which these files are installed) you may also
need to adjust the package prototypes in usr/src/pkgdefs to
reflect that such changes.
</p></div><div class="sect3" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="_3_3_3_3_Adding_New_Libraries"></a>3.3.3.3 Adding New Libraries</h4></div></div></div><p>
This section describes the overall layout and operation of the library
makefiles and provides detailed step-by-step instructions for adding new
libraries and enhancing existing library makefiles.  This is based very
closely on the file usr/src/lib/README.Makefiles and will be updated
from time to time to match its contents.
</p><p>
Your library should consist of a hierarchical collection of Makefiles:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>lib/&lt;library&gt;/Makefile:</p><p>
This is your library's top-level Makefile.  It should
contain rules for building any ISA-independent targets, such
as installing header files and building message catalogs,
but should defer all other targets to ISA-specific
Makefiles.
</p></li><li><p>lib/&lt;library&gt;/Makefile.com</p><p>
This is your library's common Makefile.  It should contain
rules and macros which are common to all ISAs. This Makefile
should never be built explicitly, but instead should be
included (using the make include mechanism) by all of your
ISA-specific Makefiles.
</p></li><li><p>lib/&lt;library&gt;/&lt;isa&gt;/Makefile</p><p>
These are your library's ISA-specific Makefiles, one per ISA
(usually sparc and i386, and sometimes sparcv9 and ia64).
These Makefiles should include your common Makefile and then
provide any needed ISA-specific rules and definitions,
perhaps overriding those provided in your common Makefile.
</p><p>
To simplify their maintenance and construction, $(SRC)/lib has a
handful of provided Makefiles that yours must include; the examples
provided throughout the document will show how to use them.  Please be
sure to consult these Makefiles before introducing your own custom
build macros or rules.
</p></li><li><p>lib/Makefile.lib:</p><p>
This contains the bulk of the macros for building shared objects.
</p></li><li><p>lib/Makefile.lib.64</p><p>
This contains macros for building 64-bit objects, and should
be included in Makefiles for 64-bit native ISAs.
</p></li><li><p>lib/Makefile.rootfs</p><p>
This contains macro overrides for libraries that install
into /lib (rather than /usr/lib).
</p></li><li><p>lib/Makefile.targ</p><p>
This contains rules for building shared objects.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
The remainder of this document discusses how to write each of your
Makefiles in detail, and provides examples from the libinetutil
library.
</p><p>
<span class="bold"><strong>The Library Top-level Makefile</strong></span>
</p><p>
As described above, your top-level library Makefile should contain
rules for building ISA-independent targets, but should defer the
building of all other targets to ISA-specific Makefiles.  The
ISA-independent targets usually consist of:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>install_h</p><p>
Install all library header files into the proto area.  Can
be omitted if your library has no header files.
</p></li><li><p>check</p><p>
Check all library header files for hdrchk compliance.  Can
be omitted if your library has no header files.
</p></li><li><p>_msg</p><p>
Build and install a message catalog.  Can be omitted if your
library has no message catalog.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
Of course, other targets are (such as `cstyle') are fine as well, as
long as they are ISA-independent.
</p><p>
The ROOTHDRS and CHECKHDRS targets are provided in lib/Makefile.lib to
make it easy for you to install and check your library's header files.
To use these targets, your Makefile must set the HDRS to the list of
your library's header files to install and HDRDIR to the their
location in the source tree.  In addition, if your header files need
to be installed in a location other than $(ROOT)/usr/include, your
Makefile must also set ROOTHDRDIR to the appropriate location in the
proto area.  Once HDRS, HDRDIR and (optionally) ROOTHDRDIR have been
set, your Makefile need only contain
</p><pre class="programlisting">
install_h: $(ROOTHDRS)
</pre><pre class="programlisting">
check: $(CHECKHDRS)
</pre><p>
to bind the provided targets to the standard `install_h' and `check'
rules.
</p><p>
Similar rules are provided (in $(SRC)/Makefile.msg.targ) to make it
easy for you to build and install message catalogs from your library's
source files.
</p><p>
To install a catalog into the catalog directory in the proto area,
define the POFILE macro to be the name of your catalog, and specify
that the _msg target depends on $(MSGDOMAINPOFILE).  The examples
below should clarify this.
</p><p>
To build a message catalog from arbitrarily many message source files,
use the BUILDPO.msgfiles macro.
</p><pre class="programlisting">
include ../Makefile.lib
</pre><pre class="programlisting">
POFILE =	  libfoo.po
MSGFILES =	  $(OBJECTS:%.o=%.i)
</pre><pre class="programlisting">
# ...
</pre><pre class="programlisting">
$(POFILE): $(MSGFILES)
		$(BUILDPO.msgfiles)
</pre><pre class="programlisting">
_msg: $(MSGDOMAINPOFILE)
</pre><pre class="programlisting">
include $(SRC)/Makefile.msg.targ
</pre><p>
Note that this example doesn't use grep to find message files, since
that can mask unreferenced files, and potentially lead to the
inclusion of unwanted messages or omission of intended messages in the
catalogs.  As such, MSGFILES should be derived from a known list of
objects or sources.
</p><p>
It is usually preferable to run the source through the C preprocessor
prior to extracting messages.  To do this, use the ".i" suffix, as
shown in the above example.  If you need to skip the C preprocessor,
just use the native (.[ch]) suffix.
</p><p>
The only time you shouldn't use BUILDPO.msgfiles as the preferred
means of extracting messages in when you're extracting them from shell
scripts; in that case, you can use the BUILDPO.pofiles macro as
explained below.
</p><p>
To build a message catalog from other message catalogs, or from source
files that include shell scripts, use the BUILDPO.pofiles macro:
</p><pre class="programlisting">
include ../Makefile.lib
</pre><pre class="programlisting">
SUBDIRS =	  $(MACH)
</pre><pre class="programlisting">
POFILE =	  libfoo.po
POFILES =	  $(SUBDIRS:%=%/_%.po)
</pre><pre class="programlisting">
_msg :=	  TARGET = _msg
</pre><pre class="programlisting">
# ...
</pre><pre class="programlisting">
$(POFILE): $(POFILES)
		$(BUILDPO.pofiles)
</pre><pre class="programlisting">
_msg: $(MSGDOMAINPOFILE)
</pre><pre class="programlisting">
include $(SRC)/Makefile.msg.targ
</pre><p>
The Makefile above would work in conjunction with the following in its
subdirectories' Makefiles:
</p><pre class="programlisting">
POFILE =	  _thissubdir.po
MSGFILES =	  $(OBJECTS:%.o=%.i)
</pre><pre class="programlisting">
$(POFILE):	  $(MSGFILES)
		  $(BUILDPO.msgfiles)
</pre><pre class="programlisting">
_msg:		  $(POFILE)
</pre><pre class="programlisting">
include $(SRC)/Makefile.msg.targ
</pre><p>
Since this POFILE will be combined with those in other subdirectories
by the parent Makefile and that merged file will be installed into the
proto area via MSGDOMAINPOFILE, there is no need to use
MSGDOMAINPOFILE in this Makefile (in fact, using it would lead to
duplicate messages in the catalog).
</p><p>
When using any of these targets, keep in mind that other macros, like
XGETFLAGS and TEXT_DOMAIN may also be set in your Makefile to override
or augment the defaults provided in higher-level Makefiles.
</p><p>
As previously mentioned, you should defer all ISA-specific targets to
your ISA-specific Makefiles.  You can do this by:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>1 Setting SUBDIRS to the list of directories to descend into:</p><pre class="programlisting">
SUBDIRS = $(MACH)
</pre><p>
Note that if your library is also built 64-bit, then you
should also specify
</p><pre class="programlisting">
$(BUILD64)SUBDIRS += $(MACH64)
</pre><p>
so that SUBDIRS contains $(MACH64) if and only if you're
compiling on a 64-bit ISA.
</p></li><li><p>2 Providing a common "descend into SUBDIRS" rule:</p><pre class="programlisting">
spec $(SUBDIRS): FRC
	@cd $@; pwd; $(MAKE) $(TARGET)
</pre><pre class="programlisting">
FRC:
</pre></li><li><p>3 Providing a collection of conditional assignments that set
TARGET appropriately:</p><pre class="programlisting">
all	:= TARGET= all
clean	:= TARGET= clean
clobber := TARGET= clobber
install := TARGET= install
lint	:= TARGET= lint
</pre><p>
The order doesn't matter, but alphabetical is preferable.
</p></li><li><p>4 Having the aforementioned targets depend on SUBDIRS:</p><pre class="programlisting">
all clean clobber install: spec .WAIT $(SUBDIRS)
</pre><pre class="programlisting">
lint: $(SUBDIRS)
</pre></li></ul></div><p>
A few notes are in order here:
</p><p>
* The `all' target must be listed first; the others
might as well be listed alphabetically.
</p><p>
* The `lint' target is listed separately because there
is nothing to lint in the spec subdirectory.
</p><p>
* The .WAIT between spec and $(SUBDIRS) is suboptimal
but currently required to make sure that two
different make invocations don't simultaneously
build the mapfiles.  It will likely be replaced with
a more sophisticated mechanism in the future.
</p><p>
As an example of how all of this goes together, here's libinetutil's
top-level library Makefile (copyright omitted):
</p><pre class="programlisting">
include ../Makefile.lib
</pre><pre class="programlisting">
HDRS =		libinetutil.h
HDRDIR =	common
SUBDIRS =	$(MACH)
$(BUILD64)SUBDIRS += $(MACH64)
</pre><pre class="programlisting">
all :=		TARGET = all
clean :=	TARGET = clean
clobber :=	TARGET = clobber
install :=	TARGET = install
lint :=		TARGET = lint
</pre><pre class="programlisting">
.KEEP_STATE:
</pre><pre class="programlisting">
all clean clobber install: spec .WAIT $(SUBDIRS)
</pre><pre class="programlisting">
lint:		$(SUBDIRS)
</pre><pre class="programlisting">
install_h:	$(ROOTHDRS)
</pre><pre class="programlisting">
check:		$(CHECKHDRS)
</pre><pre class="programlisting">
$(SUBDIRS) spec: FRC
	@cd $@; pwd; $(MAKE) $(TARGET)
</pre><pre class="programlisting">
FRC:
</pre><pre class="programlisting">
include ../Makefile.targ
</pre><p>
<span class="bold"><strong>The Common Makefile</strong></span>
</p><p>
In concept, your common Makefile should contain all of the rules and
definitions that are the same on all ISAs.  However, for reasons of
maintainability and cleanliness, you're encouraged to place even
ISA-dependent rules and definitions, as long you express them in an
ISA-independent way (e.g., by using $(MACH), $(TRANSMACH), and their
kin).
</p><p>
The common Makefile can be conceptually split up into four sections:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>1 A copyright and comments section.</p><p>
Please see the prototype
files in usr/src/prototypes for examples of how to format the
copyright message properly.  For brevity and clarity, this
section has been omitted from the examples shown here.
</p></li><li><p>2 A list of macros that must be defined prior to the inclusion of Makefile.lib.</p><p>
This section is conceptually
terminated by the inclusion of Makefile.lib, followed, if
necessary, by the inclusion of Makefile.rootfs (only if the
library is to be installed in /lib rather than the default
/usr/lib).
</p></li><li><p>3 A list of macros that need not be defined prior to the
	   inclusion of Makefile.lib</p><p>
(or which must be defined
following the inclusion of Makefile.lib, to override or
augment its definitions).  This section is conceptually
terminated by the .KEEP_STATE directive.
</p></li><li><p>4 A list of targets.</p></li></ul></div><p>
The first section is self-explanatory.  The second typically consists
of the following macros:
</p><p>
<code class="code">LIBRARY</code>
</p><p>
Set to the name of the static version of your library, such as
`libinetutil.a'.  You should always specify the `.a' suffix, since
pattern-matching rules in higher-level Makefiles rely on it, even though
static libraries are not normally built in <a href="apa.html#_ON">ON</a>, and are never
installed in the proto area.  Note that the LIBS macro (described below)
controls the types of libraries that are built when building your
library.
</p><p>
If you are building a loadable module (i.e., a shared object that is
only linked at runtime with dlopen(3dl)), specify the name of the
loadable module with a `.a' suffix, such as `devfsadm_mod.a'.
</p><p>
<code class="code">VERS</code>
</p><p>
Set to the version of your shared library, such as `.1'.  You actually
do not need to set this prior to the inclusion of Makefile.lib, but it
is good practice to do so since VERS and LIBRARY are so closely related.
</p><p>
<code class="code">OBJECTS</code>
</p><p>
Set to the list of object files contained in your library, such as `a.o
b.o'.  Usually, this will be the same as your library's source files
(except with .o extensions), but if your library compiles source files
outside of the library directory itself, it will differ.  We'll see an
example of this with libinetutil.
</p><p>
The third section typically consists of the following macros:
</p><p>
<code class="code">LIBS</code>
</p><p>
Set to the list of the types of libraries to build when building your
library.  For dynamic libraries, you should set this to `$(DYNLIB)
$(LINTLIB)' so that a dynamic library and lint library are built.  For
loadable modules, you should just list DYNLIB, since there's no point in
building a lint library for libraries that are never linked at
compile-time.
</p><p>
If your library needs to be built as a static library (typically to be
used in other parts of the build), you should set LIBS to `$(LIBRARY)'.
However, you should do this only when absolutely necessary, and you must
*never* ship static libraries to customers.
</p><p>
<code class="code">ROOTLIBDIR</code> (if your library installs to a nonstandard directory)
</p><p>
Set to the directory your 32-bit shared objects will install into with
the standard $(ROOTxxx) macros.  Since this defaults to $(ROOT)/usr/lib
($(ROOT)/lib if you included Makefile.rootfs), you usually do not need
to set this.
</p><p>
<code class="code">ROOTLIBDIR64</code> (if your library installs to a nonstandard directory)
</p><p>
Set to the directory your 64-bit shared objects will install into with
the standard $(ROOTxxx64) macros.  Since this defaults to
$(ROOT)/usr/lib/$(MACH64) ($(ROOT)/lib/$(MACH64) if you included
Makefile.rootfs), you usually do not need to set this.
</p><p>
<code class="code">SRCDIR</code>
</p><p>
Set to the directory containing your library's source files, such as
`../common'.  Because this Makefile is actually included from your
ISA-specific Makefiles, make sure you specify the directory relative to
your library's &lt;isa&gt; directory.
</p><p>
<code class="code">SRCS</code> (if necessary)
</p><p>
Set to the list of source files required to build your library.  This
defaults to $(OBJECTS:%.o=$(SRCDIR)/%.c) in Makefile.lib, so you only
need to set this when source files from directories other than SRCDIR
are needed.  Keep in mind that SRCS should be set to a list of source
file *pathnames*, not just a list of filenames.
</p><p>
LINTLIB-specific SRCS (required if building a <a href="apa.html#_lint">lint</a> library)
</p><p>
Set to a special "lint stubs" file to use when constructing your
library's lint library.  The lint stubs file must be used to guarantee
that programs that link against your library will be able to lint clean.
To do this, you must conditionally set SRCS to use your stubs file by
specifying `LINTLIB := SRCS= $(SRCDIR)/$(LINTSRC)' in your Makefile.  Of
course, you do not need to set this if your library does not build a
lint library.
</p><p>
<code class="code">LDLIBS</code>
</p><p>
Appended with the list of libraries and library directories needed to
build your library; minimally "-lc".  Note that this should *never* be
set, since that will inadvertently clear the library search path,
causing the linker to look in the wrong place for the libraries.
</p><p>
Since lint targets also make use of LDLIBS, LDLIBS *must* only contain
-l and -L directives; all other link-related directives should be put in
DYNFLAGS (if they apply only to shared object construction) or LDFLAGS
(if they apply in general).
</p><p>
<code class="code">MAPDIR</code>
</p><p>
Set to the directory in which your library mapfile is built.  If your
library builds its mapfile from specfiles, set this to
`../spec/$(TRANSMACH)' (TRANSMACH is the same as MACH for 32-bit
targets, and the same as MACH64 for 64-bit targets).
</p><p>
<code class="code">MAPFILE</code> (required if your mapfile is under source control)
</p><p>
Set to the path to your library mapfile.  If your library builds its
mapfile from specfiles, this need not be set.  If you set this, you must
also set DYNFLAGS to include `-M $(MAPFILE)' and set DYNLIB to depend on
MAPFILE.
</p><p>
<code class="code">SPECMAPFILE</code> (required if your mapfile is generated from specfiles)
</p><p>
Set to the path to your generated mapfile (usually `$(MAPDIR)/mapfile').
If your library mapfile is under source control, you need not set this.
Setting this triggers a number of features in higher-level Makefiles:
</p><p>
* Your shared library will automatically be linked with `-M $(SPECMAPFILE)'.
</p><p>
* A `make clobber' will remove $(SPECMAPFILE).
</p><p>
* Changes to $(SPECMAPFILE) will cause your shared library to be rebuilt.
</p><p>
* An attempt to build $(SPECMAPFILE) will
automatically cause a `make mapfile' to be done in
MAPDIR.
</p><p>
<code class="code">CPPFLAGS</code> (if necessary)
</p><p>
Appended with any flags that need to be passed to the C preprocessor
(typically -D and -I flags).  Since lint macros use CPPFLAGS, CPPFLAGS
*must* only contain directives known to the C preprocessor.  When
compiling MT-safe code, CPPFLAGS *must* include -D_REENTRANT.  When
compiling large file aware code, CPPFLAGS *must* include
-D_FILE_OFFSET_BITS=64.
</p><p>
<code class="code">CFLAGS</code>
</p><p>
Appended with any flags that need to be passed to the C compiler.
Minimally, append `$(CCVERBOSE)'.  Keep in mind that you should add any
C preprocessor flags to CPPFLAGS, not CFLAGS.
</p><p>
<code class="code">CFLAGS64</code> (if necessary)
</p><p>
Appended with any flags that need to be passed to the C compiler when
compiling 64-bit code.  Since all 64-bit code is compiled $(CCVERBOSE),
you usually do not need to modify CFLAGS64.
</p><p>
<code class="code">COPTFLAG</code> (if necessary)
</p><p>
Set to control the optimization level used by the C compiler when
compiling 32-bit code.  You should only set this if absolutely
necessary, and it should only contain optimization-related settings (or
-g).
</p><p>
<code class="code">COPTFLAG64</code> (if necessary)
</p><p>
Set to control the optimization level used by the C compiler when
compiling 64-bit code.  You should only set this if absolutely
necessary, and it should only contain optimization-related settings (or
-g).
</p><p>
<code class="code">LINTFLAGS</code> (if necessary)
</p><p>
Appended with any flags that need to be passed to lint(1) when linting
32-bit code.  You should only modify LINTFLAGS in rare instances where
your code cannot (or should not) be fixed.
</p><p>
<code class="code">LINTFLAGS64</code> (if necessary)
</p><p>
Appended with any flags that need to be passed to lint(1) when linting
64-bit code.  You should only modify LINTFLAGS64 in rare instances where
your code cannot (or should not) be fixed.
</p><p>
Of course, you may use other macros as necessary.
</p><p>
The fourth section typically consists of the following targets:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>all</p><p>
Build all of the types of the libraries named by LIBS.  Must always be
the first real target in common Makefile.  Since the higher-level
Makefiles already contain rules to build all of the different types of
libraries, you can usually just specify
</p><pre class="programlisting">
all: $(LIBS)
</pre><p>
though it should be listed as an empty target if LIBS is set by your
ISA-specific Makefiles (see above).
</p></li><li><p>lint</p><p>
Use the `lintcheck' rule provided by lib/Makefile.targ to lint the
actual library sources.  Historically, this target has also been used to
build the lint library (using LINTLIB), but that usage is now
discouraged.  Thus, this rule should be specified as
</p><pre class="programlisting">
lint: lintcheck
</pre></li></ul></div><p>
Conspicuously absent from this section are the `clean' and `clobber'
targets.  These targets are already provided by lib/Makefile.targ and
thus should not be provided by your common Makefile.  Instead, your
common Makefile should list any additional files to remove during a
`clean' and `clobber' by appending to the CLEANFILES and CLOBBERFILES
macros.
</p><p>
Once again, here's libinetutil's common Makefile, which shows how many
of these directives go together.  Note that Makefile.rootfs is included
to cause libinetutil.so.1 to be installed in /lib rather than /usr/lib:
</p><pre class="programlisting">
LIBRARY =	libinetutil.a
VERS =		.1
OBJECTS =	octet.o inetutil4.o ifspec.o
</pre><pre class="programlisting">
include ../../Makefile.lib
include ../../Makefile.rootfs
</pre><pre class="programlisting">
LIBS =		$(DYNLIB) $(LINTLIB)
SRCS =		$(COMDIR)/octet.c $(SRCDIR)/inetutil4.c \
		$(SRCDIR)/ifspec.c
$(LINTLIB):=	SRCS = $(SRCDIR)/$(LINTSRC)
LDLIBS +=	-lsocket -lc
</pre><pre class="programlisting">
SRCDIR =	../common
COMDIR =	$(SRC)/common/net/dhcp
MAPDIR =	../spec/$(TRANSMACH)
SPECMAPFILE =	$(MAPDIR)/mapfile
</pre><pre class="programlisting">
CFLAGS +=	$(CCVERBOSE)
CPPFLAGS +=	-I$(SRCDIR)
</pre><pre class="programlisting">
.KEEP_STATE:
</pre><pre class="programlisting">
all: $(LIBS)
</pre><pre class="programlisting">
lint: lintcheck
</pre><pre class="programlisting">
pics/%.o: $(COMDIR)/%.c
	$(COMPILE.c) -o $@ $&lt;
	$(POST_PROCESS_O)
</pre><pre class="programlisting">
include ../../Makefile.targ
</pre><p>
Note that for libinetutil, not all of the object files come from SRCDIR.
To support this, an alternate source file directory named COMDIR is
defined, and the source files listed in SRCS are specified using both
COMDIR and SRCDIR.  Additionally, a special build rule is provided to
build object files from the sources in COMDIR; the rule uses COMPILE.c
and POST_PROCESS_O so that any changes to the compilation and
object-post-processing phases will be automatically picked up.
</p><p>
<span class="bold"><strong>The ISA-Specific Makefiles</strong></span>
</p><p>
As the name implies, your ISA-specific Makefiles should contain macros
and rules that cannot be expressed in an ISA-independent way.
Usually, the only rule you will need to put here is `install', which
has different dependencies for 32-bit and 64-bit libraries.  For
instance, here are the ISA-specific Makefiles for libinetutil:
</p><pre class="programlisting">
sparc/Makefile:
</pre><pre class="programlisting">
include ../Makefile.com
</pre><pre class="programlisting">
install: all $(ROOTLIBS) $(ROOTLINKS) $(ROOTLINT)
</pre><pre class="programlisting">
sparcv9/Makefile:
</pre><pre class="programlisting">
include ../Makefile.com
include ../../Makefile.lib.64
</pre><pre class="programlisting">
install: all $(ROOTLIBS64) $(ROOTLINKS64)
</pre><pre class="programlisting">
i386/Makefile:
</pre><pre class="programlisting">
include ../Makefile.com
</pre><pre class="programlisting">
install: all $(ROOTLIBS) $(ROOTLINKS) $(ROOTLINT)
</pre><p>
Observe that there is no .KEEP_STATE directive in these Makefiles,
since all of these Makefiles include libinetutil/Makefile.com, and it
already has a .KEEP_STATE directive.  Also, note that the 64-bit
Makefile also includes Makefile.lib.64, which overrides some of the
definitions contained in the higher level Makefiles included by the
common Makefile so that 64-bit compiles work correctly.
</p><p>
<span class="bold"><strong>CTF Data in Libraries</strong></span>
</p><p>
By default, all position-independent objects are built with <a href="apa.html#_CTF">CTF</a>
data using ctfconvert, which is then merged together using ctfmerge when
the shared object is built.  All C-source objects processed via ctfmerge
need to be processed via ctfconvert or the build will fail.  Objects
built from non-C sources (such as assembly or C++) are silently ignored
for CTF processing.
</p><p>
Filter libraries that have no source files will need to explicitly
disable CTF by setting CTFMERGE_LIB to ":"; see libw/Makefile.com for an
example.
</p><p>
<span class="bold"><strong>More Information</strong></span>
</p><p>
Other issues and questions will undoubtedly arise while you work on
your library's Makefiles.  To help in this regard, a number of
libraries of varying complexity have been updated to follow the
guidelines and practices outlined in this document:
