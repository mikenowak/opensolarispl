<a class="indexterm" name="indexterm-276"></a>
<a class="indexterm" name="indexterm-277"></a>Software management involves installing or removing software products.
Sun and its third-party vendors deliver software products in a form called
a <span class="emphasis"><em>package</em></span>. </p>
<p>
<a class="indexterm" name="swmgrpkgsconcepts-ix1702"></a>The term <span class="emphasis"><em>packaging</em></span> generically refers to
the method for distributing and installing software products to systems where
the products will be used. A package is a collection of files and directories
in a defined format. This format conforms to the application binary interface
(ABI), which is a supplement to the System V Interface Definition. The Solaris
OS provides a set of utilities that interpret this format and provide the
means to install a package, to remove a package, or to verify a package installation. </p>
<p>A <span class="emphasis"><em>patch</em></span> is a collection of files and directories
that replace or update existing files and directories that are preventing
proper execution of the existing software. For more information about patches,
see <span class="olink">Chapter 21, Managing Solaris Patches and Updates (Overview)</span>.</p>

<p>The terms patch and update are used interchangeably in this book.</p>

<a class="indexterm" name="indexterm-278"></a>
<a class="indexterm" name="indexterm-279"></a>
<a class="indexterm" name="indexterm-280"></a>
<a class="indexterm" name="indexterm-281"></a>
<a class="indexterm" name="indexterm-282"></a>
<a class="indexterm" name="indexterm-283"></a>
<a class="indexterm" name="indexterm-284"></a>Packages can include a digital signature. A
package with a valid digital signature ensures that the package has not been
modified since the signature was applied to the package. Using signed packages
is a secure method of downloading or adding packages because the digital signature
can be verified before the package is added to your system.</p>
<p>The same holds true for signed patches. A patch with a valid digital
signature ensures that the patch has not been modified since the signature
was applied to the patch. Using signed patches is a secure method of downloading
or applying patches because the digital signature can be verified before the
patch is applied to your system.</p>
<p>For more information about <span class="emphasis"><em>applying</em></span> signed patches
to your system, see  <span class="olink">Managing Solaris Patches by Using the Sun Patch Manager Command-Line Interface (Task Map)</span> or <span class="olink">Managing Solaris Patches by Using the <span><strong class="command">patchadd</strong></span> Command (Task Map)</span>.</p>
<p>For information about <span class="emphasis"><em>creating</em></span> signed packages,
see <span class="olink">
<em class="citetitle">Application Packaging Developer&#8217;s Guide</em>
</span>.</p>
<p>A signed package is identical to an unsigned package, except for the
digital signature. The package can be installed, queried, or removed with
existing Solaris packaging tools. A signed package is also binary-compatible
with an unsigned package.</p>
<p>Before you can use <span><strong class="command">pkgadd</strong></span> and <span><strong class="command">patchadd</strong></span> to
add a package or patch with a digital signature to your system, you must set
up a package keystore with trusted certificates. These certificates are used
to identify that the digital signature on the package or patch is valid. Note
that the keystore and certificates are automatically set up when you use Patch
Manager to apply signed patches.</p>
<p>The following describes the general terms associated with signed packages
and patches.</p>
<div class="variablelist"><dl><dt><span class="term">
<span class="strong"><strong>Keystore</strong></span>
</span></dt><dd>
<p>A repository of certificates and keys that is queried when
needed.</p>
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li>
<p>Java keystore &#8211; A repository of certificates that is
installed by default with the Solaris release. The Java keystore is usually
stored in the <code class="filename">/usr/j2se/jre/lib/security</code> directory.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Package keystore &#8211; A repository of certificates that
you import when adding signed packages and patches to your system.</p>
<p>The
package keystore is stored in the <code class="filename">/var/sadm/security</code> directory
by default.</p>
</li></ul></div>
</dd><dt><span class="term">
<span class="strong"><strong>Trusted certificate</strong></span>
</span></dt><dd>
<p>A certificate that holds a public key that belongs to another
entity. The <span class="emphasis"><em>trusted certificate</em></span> is named as such because
the keystore owner trusts that the public key in the certificate indeed belongs
to the identity identified by the subject or owner of the certificate. The
issuer of the certificate vouches for this trust by signing the certificate.</p>
<p>Trusted certificates are used when verifying signatures, and when initiating
a connection to a secure (SSL) server.</p>
</dd><dt><span class="term">
<span class="strong"><strong>User key</strong></span>
</span></dt><dd>
<p>Holds sensitive cryptographic key information. This information
is stored in a protected format to prevent unauthorized access. A user key
consists of both the user's private key and the public key certificate that
corresponds to the private key.</p>
</dd></dl></div>
<p>The process of using the <span><strong class="command">pkgadd</strong></span> or <span><strong class="command">patchadd</strong></span> command
to add a signed package or patch to your system involves three basic steps:</p>
<div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li>
<p>Adding the certificates to your system's package keystore
by using the <span><strong class="command">pkgadm</strong></span> command</p>
</li><li>
<p>(Optional) Listing the certificates by using the <span><strong class="command">pkgadm</strong></span> command</p>
</li><li>
<p>Adding the package with the <span><strong class="command">pkgadd</strong></span> command
or applying the patch by using the <span><strong class="command">patchadd</strong></span> command</p>
</li></ol></div>
<p>If you use Patch Manager to apply patches to your system, you do not
need to manually set up the keystore and certificates, as it is automatically
set up.</p>

<div class="sect3" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="swmgrpkgsconcepts-28"></a>Using Sun's Certificates to Verify
Signed Packages and Patches</h4></div></div></div>

<p>Digital certificates, issued and authenticated by Sun Microsystems,
are used to verify that the downloaded package or patch with the digital signature
has not been compromised. These certificates are imported into your system's
package keystore.<a class="indexterm" name="indexterm-285"></a>
<a class="indexterm" name="indexterm-286"></a>
<a class="indexterm" name="indexterm-287"></a>
<a class="indexterm" name="indexterm-288"></a>
<a class="indexterm" name="indexterm-289"></a>
<a class="indexterm" name="indexterm-290"></a>
<a class="indexterm" name="indexterm-291"></a>
<a class="indexterm" name="indexterm-292"></a>
</p>
<p>A <span class="emphasis"><em>stream-formatted</em></span> SVR4-signed package or patch
contains an embedded PEM-encoded PKCS7 signature. This signature contains
at a minimum the encrypted digest of the package or patch, along with the
signer's X.509 public key certificate. The package or patch can also contain
a <span class="emphasis"><em>certificate chain</em></span> that is used to form a chain of trust
from the signer's certificate to a locally stored trusted certificate.</p>
<p>The PEM-encoded PKCS7 signature is used to verify the following information:</p>
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li>
<p>The package came from the entity that signed it.</p>
</li><li>
<p>The entity indeed signed it.</p>
</li><li>
<p>The package hasn't been modified since the entity signed it.</p>
</li><li>
<p>The entity that signed it is a trusted entity.</p>
</li></ul></div>
<p>All Sun certificates are issued by Baltimore Technologies, which recently
bought GTE CyberTrust.</p>
<p>Access to a package keystore is protected by a special password that
you specify when you import the Sun certificates into your system's package
keystore.</p>
<p>If you use the <span><strong class="command">pkgadm listcert</strong></span> command, you can view
information about your locally stored certificates in the package keystore.
For example:</p>
<pre class="screen"># <strong class="userinput"><code>pkgadm listcert -P pass:</code></strong>
<em class="replaceable"><code>store-pass</code></em>
    Keystore Alias: GTE CyberTrust Root
       Common Name: GTE CyberTrust Root

<p>
<a class="indexterm" name="indexterm-297"></a>
<a class="indexterm" name="indexterm-298"></a>In previous Solaris releases, you could download the patch management
tools and create a Java keystore, for use by PatchPro, by importing the certificates
with the <span><strong class="command">keytool</strong></span> command.</p>
<p>If your system already has a populated Java keystore, you can now export
the Sun Microsystems root CA certificate from the Java keystore with the <span><strong class="command">keytool</strong></span> command. Then, use the <span><strong class="command">pkgadm</strong></span> command
to import this certificate into the package keystore.</p>
<p>After the Root CA certificate is imported into the package keystore,
you can use the <span><strong class="command">pkgadd</strong></span> and <span><strong class="command">patchadd</strong></span> commands
to add signed packages and patches to your system.</p>
