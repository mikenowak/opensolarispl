is invoked. The daemon performs the following key functions.</p>
<ul><li><p><a name="indexterm-468"></a>Gains access to  the configuration files, running as root</p>
</li>
<li><p>Refreshes the client configuration information stored in the

</li>
<li><p>Maintains a sorted list of active LDAP servers to use</p>
</li>
<li><p>Improves lookup efficiency by caching some common lookup requests
submitted by various clients</p>
</li>
<li><p>Improves the efficiency of host lookups</p>
</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p><b>Note - </b><tt>ldap_cachemgr</tt> must be running at all times
for LDAP naming services to work.</p>
<hr>
<p>Refer to the <tt>ldap_cachemgr</tt>(1M) man page for detailed information.</p>
<a name="ldapsecure-66"></a><h3>LDAP Naming Services Security Model</h3>
<a name="ldapsecure-72"></a><h4>Introduction</h4>
<p>Solaris LDAP naming services can use the LDAP repository in two different ways. One is as
a source of both a naming service and an authentication service. The other is strictly as the source of naming
data, using Kerberos as the enterprise-wide authentication system.
This section discusses the concepts of client identity, authentication methods, <tt>pam_ldap</tt>(5) and <tt>pam_unix</tt> modules, and account management when the LDAP repository is used as both a naming service
and authentication service.  This section also discusses the use of LDAP naming
services in conjunction with the Kerberos environment (Part&nbsp;VI, Kerberos Service, in <i>System Administration Guide: Security Services</i>)
and <tt>pam_krb5</tt>(5) modules</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Note - </b>If you enable <tt>pam_ldap</tt> account management, all users must provide a password any
time they log in to the system. A login password is required for authentication.
Therefore, nonpassword-based logins using tools such as <tt>rsh</tt>, <tt>rlogin</tt>, or <tt>ssh</tt> will fail.</p>
<hr>
<hr>
<p><b>Note - </b>If you use
Kerberos as your authentication system and integrate it with the LDAP naming
system, you will be able to support a single sign on (SSO) environment in
your enterprise through Kerberos. You will also be able to use that same identity
system when querying LDAP naming data on a per-user or per-host basis.</p>
<hr>
<p><a name="indexterm-469"></a>To access the information in the LDAP repository, clients can
first establish identity with the directory server. This identity can be either
anonymous or as an object recognized by the LDAP server. Based on the client's
identity and the server's access control information (ACI), the LDAP server
will allow the client to read or write directory information. For more information
on ACIs, consult the <i>Administration Guide</i> for the version
of Sun Java System Directory Server that you are using.</p>
<p>If the client is connecting as anything other than anonymous for any
given request, the client must prove its identity to the server using an authentication
method supported by both the client and the server. Once the client has established
its identity, it can then make the various LDAP requests.</p>
<p>When you use <tt>pam_ldap</tt> there is a distinction between how the naming service and the authentication
service (<tt>pam_ldap</tt>) access the directory. The naming service
reads various entries and their attributes from the directory based on predefined
identity. The authentication service establishes whether the user has entered
the correct password by using that user's name and password to authenticate
to the LDAP server.  See the <tt>pam_ldap</tt>(5) man page for more information
about the authentication service.</p>
<p>When Kerberos is used to perform authentication, and
when authentication in LDAP naming services is also enabled (as is required
for per-user mode), Kerberos can provide dual functions. Kerberos authenticates
to the server and the Kerberos identity for the principal (user or host) is
used to authenticate to the directory.  In this way, the same user identity
used to authenticate to the system is also used to authenticate to the directory
for lookups. Administrators can use access control information (ACI) in the
directory to limit the results out of the naming service if desired.</p>
<a name="ldapsecure-73"></a><h4>Transport Layer Security (TLS)</h4>
<hr>
<p><b>Note - </b>In order to use TLS for Solaris LDAP naming services, the directory
server must use the default ports, 389 and 636, for LDAP and SSL, respectively.
If your directory server does not use these ports, you cannot use TLS at this
time.</p>
<hr>
<p><a name="indexterm-470"></a><a name="indexterm-471"></a>TLS can be used to secure communication between an LDAP client
and the directory server, providing both privacy and data integrity. The TLS
protocol is a superset of the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocol. Solaris
LDAP naming services support TLS connections. Be aware that using SSL adds
load to the directory server and the client.</p>
<p>You will need to set up your directory server for SSL. For more information
about setting up Sun Java System Directory Server for SSL, see the Administration Guide for the
version of Sun Java System Directory Server that you are using. You will also need to set up your
LDAP client for SSL.</p>
<p>If using TLS, the necessary security databases must be installed. In
particular, the certificate and key database files are needed. For example,
if you adopt an older database format from Netscape Communicator, two files, <tt>cert7.db</tt> and <tt>key3.db</tt>, are required. Or if
you use a new database format from Mozilla, three files, <tt>cert8.db</tt>, <tt>key3.db</tt>, and <tt>secmod.db</tt> are needed. The <tt>cert7.db</tt> or <tt>cert8.db</tt>file contains trusted
certificates. The <tt>key3.db</tt>file contains the client's keys.
Even if the LDAP naming service client does not use client keys, this file
must be present. The <tt>secmod.db</tt> file contains the security
modules such as the <tt>PKCS#11</tt> module. This file is not required
if the older format is used.</p>
<p>See <a href="p47.html#clientsetup-57">Setting Up TLS Security</a> for
more information.</p>
<a name="ldapsecure-74"></a><h4>Assigning Client Credential Levels</h4>
<p><a name="indexterm-472"></a>LDAP naming services  clients authenticate to the LDAP server
according to a client's credential level. LDAP clients can be assigned four possible credential levels
with which to authenticate to a directory server.</p>
<ul><li><p><tt>anonymous</tt></p>
</li>
<li><p><a name="indexterm-473"></a><tt>proxy</tt></p>
</li>
<li><p><a name="indexterm-474"></a><tt>proxy anonymous</tt></p>
</li>
<li><p><a name="indexterm-475"></a><a name="indexterm-476"></a><tt>self</tt> (called per user in this document)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Anonymous</b></p>
<p>If you use <tt>anonymous</tt> access, you can access only
the data that is available to everyone. In anonymous mode, an LDAP BIND operation does not take
place. Also, you should consider the security implications.
Allowing <tt>anonymous</tt> access for certain parts of the directory
implies that anyone with access to the directory has read access. If you use
an <tt>anonymous</tt> credential level, you need to allow read access
to all the LDAP naming entries and attributes.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Caution - </b>Allowing <tt>anonymous</tt> write to a directory
should never be done, as anyone could change information in the DIT to which
they have write access, including another user's password, or their own identity. </p>
<hr>
<hr>
<p><b>Note - </b>Sun Java System Directory Server allows you to restrict access based on IP addresses,
DNS name, authentication method, and time-of-day. You might want to limit
access with further restrictions. For more information, see &ldquo;Managing
Access Control&rdquo; in the <i>Administration Guide</i> for
the version of Sun Java System Directory Server that you are using.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Proxy</b></p>
<p><a name="indexterm-477"></a>The client authenticates or binds to the directory using a single proxy account.
This proxy account can be any entry that is allowed to bind to the directory.
This proxy account needs sufficient access to perform the naming service functions
on the LDAP server.  The
proxy account is a shared-per-machine resource.  That is, each user logged
into a machine using proxy access, including the root user, sees the same
results as all other users on that machine. You need to configure
the <tt>proxyDN</tt> and <tt>proxyPassword</tt> on every
client using the <tt>proxy</tt> credential level. The encrypted
 <tt>proxyPassword</tt> is stored locally on the client. You can
set up different proxies for different groups of clients. For example, you
can configure a proxy for all the sales clients  to access both the company-wide-accessible
and sales directories, while preventing sales clients from accessing human
resource directories with payroll information. Or, in the most extreme cases,
you can either assign different proxies to each client or assign just one
proxy to all clients. A typical LDAP deployment would probably lie between
the two extremes. Consider the choices carefully. Too few proxy agents might
limit your ability to control user access to resources. However, having too
many proxies complicates the setup and maintenance of the system.  You need
to grant the appropriate rights to the proxy user, depending on your environment.
 See <a href="p36.html#ldapsecure-93">Credential Storage</a> for information
on how to determine which authentication method makes the most sense for your
configuration.</p>
<p>If the password changes for a proxy user, you need to update it on every
client that uses that proxy user. If you use password aging on LDAP accounts,
be sure to turn it off for proxy users.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Note - </b>Be aware that the proxy credential level applies to all users
and processes on any given machine. If two users need to use different naming
policies, they must use different machines, or they must use the per-user authentication model.</p>
<hr>
<p>In addition, if clients are using a <tt>proxy</tt> credential
to authenticate, the <tt>proxyDN</tt> must have the same <tt>proxyPassword</tt> on all of the servers.</p>
<p><a name="indexterm-478"></a><b>Proxy anonymous</b></p>
<p><tt>Proxy anonymous</tt> is
a multi-valued entry, in that more than one credential level is defined. A
client assigned the <tt>proxy anonymous</tt> level will first attempt
to authenticate with its proxy identity. If the client is unable to authenticate
as the proxy user for whatever reason (user lockout, password expired, for
example), then the client will use anonymous access. This might lead to a
different level of service, depending on how the directory is configured.</p>
<p><a name="indexterm-479"></a><b>Per User</b></p>
<p>Per-user (self) authentication
uses the Kerberos identity (principal) to perform a lookup for each user or
each system when authenticating to the directory server. With per-user authentication,
the system administrator can use access control instructions (ACI's), access
control lists (ACL's), roles, groups or other directory access control mechanisms
to grant or deny access to specific naming service data for specific users
or systems.  </p>
<hr>
<p><b>Note - </b>When configuring per-user mode, the configuration
value to enable this mode is &ldquo;self,&rdquo; which denotes per-user mode.</p>
<hr>
<p>To use the per-user authentication model, the Kerberos single
sign-on service must be deployed. In addition, the one or more directory servers
used in the deployment must support SASL and the SASL/GSSAPI authentication
mechanism.  Because Kerberos expects to use files and DNS for host name lookups,
instead of LDAP, DNS should be deployed in this environment.  Also, to use
per-user authentication, nscd must be enabled. Nscd is not an optional component
in this configuration.</p>
<a name="ldapsecure-93"></a><h5>Credential Storage</h5>
<p><a name="indexterm-480"></a>If you configure a client to use a proxy identity, the client
saves its <tt>proxyDN</tt> and <tt>proxyPassword</tt> in <tt>/var/ldap/ldap_client_cred</tt>. For the sake of increased security,
this file is restricted to root access only, and the value of <tt>proxyPassword</tt> is encrypted. While past LDAP implementations have stored proxy
credentials in a client's profile, Solaris 9 LDAP naming services do not.
Any proxy credentials set using <tt>ldapclient</tt> during initialization
are stored locally. This results in improved security surrounding a proxy's
DN and password information. See <a href="p45.html">Chapter&nbsp;12, Setting Up LDAP Clients (Tasks)</a> for more information on setting up
client profiles.</p>
<p>If
you configure a client to use per-user authentication, the Kerberos identity
and Kerberos ticket information for each principal (each user or host) are
used during authentication.  In this environment the directory server maps
the Kerberos principal to a DN and the Kerberos credentials are used to authenticate
to that DN. The directory server can then use its access control instruction
(ACI) mechanisms to allow or deny access to naming service data as necessary.
In this situation, Kerberos ticket information is used to authenticate to
the directory server and the system does not store authentication DNs or passwords
on the system.</p>
<a name="ldapsecure-75"></a><h4>Choosing Authentication Methods</h4>
<p>When you assign the <tt>proxy</tt> or <tt>proxy-anonymous</tt> credential
level to a client, you also need to select a method by which the proxy authenticates
to the directory server. By default, the authentication method is <tt>none</tt>,
which implies anonymous access. The authentication method may also have a
transport security option associated with it.</p>
<p><a name="indexterm-481"></a>The authentication method, like the credential level, may be multivalued.
For example, in the client profile you could specify that the client first
tries to bind using the <tt>simple</tt> method secured by TLS. If
unsuccessful, the client would try to bind with the <tt>sasl/digest-MD5</tt> method.
The <tt>authenticationMethod</tt> would then be <tt>tls:simple;sasl/digest-MD5</tt> .</p>
<p>LDAP naming services support some Simple Authentication and Security
Layer (SASL) mechanisms. These mechanisms allow for a secure password exchange
without requiring TLS. However, these mechanisms do not provide data integrity
or privacy. See RFC 2222 for information on SASL.</p>
<p>The following authentication mechanisms are supported.</p>
<ul><li><p><tt>none</tt></p>
<p>The client does not authenticate
to the directory. This is equivalent to the <tt>anonymous</tt> credential
level.</p>
</li>
<li><p><a name="indexterm-482"></a><tt>simple</tt></p>
<p><a name="indexterm-483"></a>If the client machine uses the <tt>simple</tt> authentication
method, it binds to the server by sending the user's password in the clear.
The password is thus subject to snooping unless the session is protected by <tt>ipsec</tt>(7). The primary advantages of using the <tt>simple</tt> authentication
method are that all directory servers support it and that it is easy to set
up.</p>
</li>
<li><p><a name="indexterm-484"></a><tt>sasl/digest-MD5</tt></p>
<p>The client's password
is protected during authentication, but the session is not encrypted. Some
directory servers, including Sun Java System Directory Server, also support the <tt>sasl/digest-MD5</tt> authentication method. The primary advantage of <tt>digest-MD5</tt> is
that the password does not go over the wire in the clear during authentication
and therefore is more secure than the <tt>simple</tt> authentication
method. See RFC 2831 for information on  <tt>digest-MD5</tt>. <tt>digest-MD5</tt> is considered an improvement over <tt>cram-MD5</tt> for
its improved security.</p>
<p>When using <tt>sasl/digest-MD5</tt>,
the authentication is secure, but the session is not protected.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>Note - </b>If you are using Sun Java System Directory Server, the password <b>must be stored
in the clear</b> in the directory.</p>
<hr>
</li>
<li><p><tt>sasl/cram-MD5</tt></p>
<p>In this case,
the LDAP session is not encrypted, but the client's password is protected
during authentication, as authentication is performed by using <tt>sasl/cram-MD5</tt>.</p>
<p>See RFC 2195 for information on the <tt>cram-MD5</tt> authentication
method. <tt>cram-MD5</tt> is only supported by some directory servers.
For instance, Sun Java System Directory Server does not support <tt>cram-MD5</tt>.</p>
</li>
<li><p><tt>sasl/GSSAPI</tt></p>
<p>This authentication method is used in conjunction with
the self credential mode to enable per-user lookups. A per-user nscd assigned
to use the client's credentials binds to the directory server using the sasl/GSSAPI
method and the client's Kerberos credentials. Access can be controlled in
the directory server on a per-user basis.</p>
</li>
<li><p><tt>tls:simple</tt></p>
<p>The client binds
using the <tt>simple</tt> method and the session is encrypted. The
password is protected.</p>
</li>
<li><p><tt>tls:sasl/cram-MD5</tt></p>
<p>The LDAP
session is encrypted and the client authenticates to the directory server
using <tt>sasl/cram-MD5</tt>.</p>
</li>
<li><p><tt>tls:sasl/digest-MD5</tt></p>
<p>The LDAP
session is encrypted and the client authenticates to the directory server
using <tt>sasl/digest-MD5</tt>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p><b>Caution - </b>Sun Java System Directory Server requires passwords to be stored in the clear in
order to use <tt>digest-MD5</tt>. If the authentication method is
set to <tt>sasl/digest-MD5</tt> or <tt>tls:sasl/digest-MD5</tt>,
then the passwords for the proxy user will need to be stored in the clear.
Be especially careful that the <tt>userPassword</tt> attribute has
the proper ACIs if it is stored in the clear, so that it is not readable.</p>
