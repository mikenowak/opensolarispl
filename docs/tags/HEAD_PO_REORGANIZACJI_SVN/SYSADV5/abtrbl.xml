</sect3><sect3 id="abtrbl-57"><title><command>ypwhich</command> Displays Are Inconsistent</title><para>When you use <command>ypwhich</command> several times on the same client, the resulting display varies because the NIS server changes. This is normal. The binding of the NIS client to the NIS server changes over time when the network or the NIS servers are busy. Whenever
possible, the network becomes stable at a point where all clients get acceptable response time from the NIS servers. As long as your client machine gets NIS service, it does not matter where the service comes from. For example, an NIS server machine can get its own NIS services from another NIS server on the network.</para>
</sect3><sect3 id="abtrbl-58"><title>When Server Binding is Not Possible</title><para>In extreme cases where local server binding is not possible, use of the <command>ypset</command> command can temporarily allow binding to another server, if available, on another network or subnet. However, in order to use the <option>ypset</option> option, <command>ypbind</command> must be started with either the <option>ypset</option> or <option>ypsetme</option> options.</para><note><para>For security reasons, the use of the <option>ypset</option> and <option>ypsetme</option> options should be limited to debugging purposes under controlled circumstances. Use of the <option>ypset</option> and <option>ypsetme</option> options can result in serious security breaches because while the daemons are running, anyone can alter server bindings causing trouble for others and permitting unauthorized access to sensitive data. If you must start <command>ypbind</command> with these options,
once you have fixed the problem you should kill <command>ypbind</command> and restart it again without those options.</para>
