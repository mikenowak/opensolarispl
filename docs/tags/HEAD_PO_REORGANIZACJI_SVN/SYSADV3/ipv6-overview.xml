the autoconfiguration of IPv6 addresses. <emphasis>Autoconfiguration</emphasis> is
the ability of an IPv6 host to automatically generate its own IPv6 address,

these IPv4 protocols: Address Resolution Protocol (ARP), Internet Control

routers use Neighbor Discovery to advertise the IPv6 site prefix. IPv6 hosts
use Neighbor Discovery for various purposes, which include soliciting the
prefix from an IPv6 router. For more information, see <olink targetptr="chapter1-40" remap="internal">IPv6 Neighbor Discovery Protocol Overview</olink>.</para>

</sect1><sect1 id="chapter1-42"><title>IPv6 Address Autoconfiguration</title><para>A major feature of IPv6 is a host's ability to autoconfigure an interface.
Through Neighbor Discovery, the host locates an IPv6 router on the local link
and requests a site prefix. The host does the following, as part of the autoconfiguration
process:</para><itemizedlist><listitem><para>Creates a link-local address for each interface, which does
not require a router on the link.</para>

</itemizedlist><note><para>Stateful autoconfiguration is achieved through DHCPv6. DHCPv6
is not supported in the current Solaris release.</para>
</note><sect2 id="chapter1-49"><title>Stateless Autoconfiguration Overview</title><para>Stateless autoconfiguration requires no manual configuration of hosts,
minimal (if any) configuration of routers, and no additional servers. The
stateless mechanism enables a host to generate its own addresses. The stateless
mechanism  uses  local information as well as nonlocal information that is
advertised by routers to generate the addresses.</para><para>You can implement temporary addresses for an interface, which are also
autoconfigured. You enable a temporary address token for one or more interfaces
on a host. However, unlike standard, autoconfigured IPv6 addresses, a temporary
address consists of the site prefix and a randomly generated 64 bit number.
This random number becomes the interface ID portion of the IPv6 address. A
link-local address is not generated with the temporary address as the interface
ID.</para><para>Routers advertise all prefixes that have been assigned on the link.
IPv6 hosts use Neighbor Discovery to obtain a subnet prefix from a local router.
Hosts automatically create IPv6 addresses by combining the subnet prefix with
an interface ID that is generated from an interface's MAC address. In the
absence of routers, a host can generate only link-local addresses. Link-local
addresses can only be used for communication with nodes on the same link.</para><note><para>Do not use stateless autoconfiguration to create the IPv6 addresses
of servers. Hosts automatically generate interface IDs that are based on hardware-specific
information during autoconfiguration. The current interface ID could become
invalid if the existing interface is swapped for a new interface. </para>
