<sect1 id="ipv6-overview-160"><title>Overview of IPv6 Tunnels</title><para>For most enterprises, the introduction of IPv6 to an existing IPv4 network
must occur on a gradual, step-by-step basis. The Solaris dual-stack network
environment supports both IPv4 and IPv6 functionality. Because most networks
use the IPv4 protocol, IPv6 networks currently require a way to communicate
outside their borders. IPv6 networks use tunnels for this purpose.</para><para>In most IPv6 tunneling scenarios, the outbound IPv6 packet is encapsulated
inside an IPv4 packet. The boundary router of the IPv6 network sets up a point-to-point
tunnel over various IPv4 networks to the boundary router of the destination
IPv6 network. The packet travels over the tunnel to the destination network's
boundary router, which decapsulates the packet. Then, the router forwards
the separate IPv6 packet to the destination node. </para><para>The Solaris IPv6 implementation supports the following tunneling scenarios:</para><itemizedlist><listitem><para>A manually configured tunnel between two IPv6 networks, over
