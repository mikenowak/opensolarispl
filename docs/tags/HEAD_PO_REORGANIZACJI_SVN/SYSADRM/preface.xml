plan to use.</para><note><para>This Solaris release supports systems that use the <trademark class="registered">SPARC</trademark> and x86 families of processor architectures: <trademark class="registered">UltraSPARC</trademark>, SPARC64, AMD64, Pentium, and Xeon
EM64T. The supported systems appear in the <citetitle>Solaris 10 Hardware
Compatibility List</citetitle> at <ulink type="text" url="http://www.sun.com/bigadmin/hcl">http://www.sun.com/bigadmin/hcl</ulink>. This document cites any

</highlights><sect1 id="preface-10"><title>About Solaris Containers</title><para>A Solaris Container is a complete runtime environment for applications.
Solaris Resource Manager and Solaris Zones software partitioning technology
are both parts of the container. These components address different qualities
the container can deliver and work together to create a complete container.
The zones portion of the container provides a virtual mapping from the application
to the platform resources. Zones allow application components to be isolated
from one another even though the zones share a single instance of the Solaris
Operating System. Resource management features permit you to allocate the
quantity of resources that a workload receives.</para><para>The container establishes boundaries for resource consumption, such
as CPU. These boundaries can be expanded to adapt to changing processing requirements
of the application running in the container.</para>
</sect1><sect1 id="gdutc"><title>About Solaris Containers for Linux Applications</title><para>Solaris Containers for Linux Applications use Sun's BrandZ technology
to run Linux applications on the Solaris Operating System. Linux applications
run unmodified in the secure environment provided by the non-global zone feature.
This enables you to use the Solaris system to develop, test, and deploy Linux
applications.</para><para>To use this feature, see <olink targetptr="gchhk" remap="internal">Part&#160;III, Branded
Zones</olink>.</para>

more systems that run the Solaris release. To use this book, you should have
at least one to two years of <trademark class="registered">UNIX</trademark> system
administration experience.</para>
