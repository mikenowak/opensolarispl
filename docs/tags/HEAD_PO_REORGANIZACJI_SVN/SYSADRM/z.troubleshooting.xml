</sect1><sect1><title>Zone Administrator Mounting Over File Systems Populated by the
Global Zone</title><para>The presence of files within a file system hierarchy when a non-global
zone is first booted indicates that the file system data is managed by the
global zone. When the non-global zone was installed, a number of the packaging
files in the global zone were duplicated inside the zone. These files must
reside under the <literal>zonepath</literal> directly. If the files reside
under a file system created by a zone administrator on disk devices or ZFS
datasets added to the zone, packaging and patching problems could occur.</para><para>The issue with storing any of the file system data that is managed by
the global zone in a zone-local file system can be described by using ZFS
as an example. If a ZFS dataset has been delegated to a non-global zone, the
zone administrator should not use that dataset to store any of the file system
data that is managed by the global zone. The configuration could not be patched
or upgraded correctly.</para><para>For example, a ZFS delegated dataset should not be used as a <literal>/var</literal> file
system. The Solaris operating system delivers core packages that install components
into <literal>/var</literal>.  These packages have to access <literal>/var</literal> when
they are upgraded or patched, which is not possible if <literal>/var</literal> is
mounted on a delegated ZFS dataset.</para><para>File system mounts under parts of the hierarchy controlled by the global
zone are supported. For example, if an empty <literal>/usr/local</literal> directory
exists in the global zone, the zone administrator can mount other contents
under that directory.</para><para>You can use a delegated ZFS dataset for file systems that do not need
to be accessed during patching or upgrade, such as <literal>/export</literal> in
the non-global zone. </para>

Booting Zone</title><para>If you see the following message when you boot the zone as described

zoneadm: zone 'my-zone': WARNING: hme0:1: no matching subnet
	found in netmasks(4) for 192.168.0.1; using default of
	255.255.255.0.</screen><para>The message is only a warning, and the command has succeeded. The message
indicates that the system was unable to find the <literal>netmask</literal> to
be used for the IP address specified in the zone's configuration.</para><para>To stop the warning from displaying on subsequent reboots, ensure that
the correct <command>netmasks</command> databases are listed in the <filename>/etc/nsswitch.conf</filename> file in the global zone and that at least one of these databases
contains the subnet and <literal>netmasks</literal> to be used for the zone <literal>my-zone</literal>.</para><para>For example, if the <filename>/etc/inet/netmasks</filename> file and
the local NIS database are used for resolving <literal>netmasks</literal> in
the global zone, the appropriate entry in <filename>/etc/nsswitch.conf</filename> is
as follows:</para><para><literal>netmasks: files nis</literal></para><para>The subnet and corresponding netmask information for the zone <literal>my-zone</literal> can then be added to <filename>/etc/inet/netmasks</filename> for
subsequent use.</para><para>For more information about the <command>netmasks</command> command,
see the <olink targetdoc="refman4" targetptr="netmasks-4" remap="external"><citerefentry><refentrytitle>netmasks</refentrytitle><manvolnum>4</manvolnum></citerefentry></olink> man
page.</para>
</sect1><sect1 id="gcrsr"><title>Zone Does Not Halt</title><para>In the event that the system state associated with the zone cannot be
destroyed, the halt operation will fail halfway. This leaves the zone in an
intermediate state, somewhere between running and installed. In this state
there are no active user processes or kernel threads, and none can be created.
When the halt operation fails, you must manually intervene to complete the
process.</para><para>The most common cause of a failure is the inability of the system to
unmount all file systems. Unlike a traditional Solaris system shutdown, which
destroys the system state, zones must ensure that no mounts performed while
booting the zone or during zone operation remain once the zone has been halted.
Even though <command>zoneadm</command> makes sure that there are no processes
executing in the zone, the unmount operation can fail if processes in the
global zone have open files in the zone. Use the tools described in the <citerefentry><refentrytitle>proc</refentrytitle><manvolnum>1</manvolnum></citerefentry> (see <command>pfiles</command>) and <citerefentry><refentrytitle>fuser</refentrytitle><manvolnum>1M</manvolnum></citerefentry> man pages to find these processes
and take appropriate action. After these processes have been dealt with, reinvoking <command>zoneadm</command> <command>halt</command> will completely halt the zone.</para>
