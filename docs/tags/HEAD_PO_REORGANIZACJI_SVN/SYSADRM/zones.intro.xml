</highlights><sect1 id="zones.intro-2"><title>Zones Overview</title><para>The Solaris Zones partitioning technology is used to virtualize
operating system services and provide an isolated and secure environment for
running applications. A <emphasis>zone</emphasis> is a virtualized operating
system environment created within a single instance of the Solaris Operating
System. When you create a zone, you produce an application execution environment
in which processes are isolated from the rest of the system. This isolation
prevents processes that are running in one zone from monitoring or affecting
processes that are running in other zones. Even a process running with superuser
credentials cannot view or affect activity in other zones.</para><para>A zone also provides an abstract layer that separates applications from
the physical attributes of the machine on which they are deployed. Examples
of these attributes include physical device paths.</para><para>Zones can be used on any machine that is running the Solaris 10 or later
release. The upper limit for the number of zones on a system is 8192. The
number of zones that can be effectively hosted on a single system is determined
by the total resource requirements of the application software running in
all of the zones.</para><para>There are two types of non-global zone root file
system models: sparse and whole root. The <emphasis>sparse root zone</emphasis> model
optimizes the sharing of objects. The <emphasis>whole root zone</emphasis> model
provides the maximum configurability. These concepts are discussed in <olink targetptr="z.conf.start-1" remap="internal">Chapter&#160;18, Planning and Configuring Non-Global
Zones (Tasks)</olink>.</para>
</sect1><sect1 id="zones.intro-3"><title>When to Use Zones</title><para>Zones are ideal for environments that consolidate a number of applications
on a single server. The cost and complexity of managing numerous machines
make it advantageous to consolidate several applications on larger, more scalable
servers.</para><para>The following figure shows a system with four zones. Each of the zones <literal>apps</literal>, <literal>users</literal>, and <literal>work</literal> is running
a workload unrelated to the workloads of the other zones, in a sample consolidated
environment. This example illustrates that different versions of the same
application can be run without negative consequences in different zones, to
match the consolidation requirements. Each zone can provide a customized set
of services.</para><figure id="zones.intro-fig-14"><title>Zones Server Consolidation Example</title><mediaobject><imageobject><imagedata entityref="serv-con-zones" width="100"/>
</imageobject><textobject><simpara>Different versions of same application can be run in
different zones without negative consequences.</simpara>
</textobject>
</mediaobject>
</figure><para>Zones enable more efficient resource utilization on your system. Dynamic
resource reallocation permits unused resources to be shifted to other containers
as needed. Fault and security isolation mean that poorly behaved applications
do not require a dedicated and under-utilized system. With the use of zones,
these applications can be consolidated with other applications.</para><para>Zones allow you to delegate some administrative functions while maintaining
overall system security.</para>
</sect1><sect1 id="zones.intro-5"><title>How Zones Work</title><para>A non-global zone can be thought of as a box. One or more applications
can run in this box without interacting with the rest of the system. Solaris
zones isolate software applications or services by using flexible, software-defined
boundaries. Applications that are running in the same instance of the Solaris
Operating System can then be managed independently of one other. Thus, different
versions of the same application can be run in different zones, to match the
requirements of your configuration.</para><para>A process assigned to a zone can manipulate, monitor, and directly communicate
with other processes that are assigned to the same zone. The process cannot
perform these functions with processes that are assigned to other zones in
the system or with processes that are not assigned to a zone. Processes that
are assigned to different zones are only able to communicate through network
APIs.</para><para>IP networking can be configured in two different ways, depending on
whether the zone has its own exclusive IP instance or shares the IP layer
configuration and state with the global zone. For more information about IP
types in zones, see <olink targetptr="z.config.ov-6" remap="internal">Zone Network Interfaces</olink>.
For configuration information, see <olink targetptr="z.conf.start-29" remap="internal">How
to Configure the Zone</olink>.</para><para>Every Solaris system contains a <emphasis>global zone</emphasis>.
The global zone has a dual function. The global zone is both the default zone
for the system and the zone used for system-wide administrative control. All
processes run in the global zone if no <emphasis>non-global</emphasis> zones,
referred to simply as zones, are created by the <emphasis>global administrator</emphasis>.</para><para>The global zone is the only zone from which a non-global zone can be
configured, installed, managed, or uninstalled. Only the global zone is bootable
from the system hardware. Administration of the system infrastructure, such
as physical devices, routing, or dynamic reconfiguration (DR), is only possible
in the global zone. Appropriately privileged processes running in the global
zone can access objects associated with other zones.</para><para>Unprivileged processes in the global zone might be able to perform operations
not allowed to privileged processes in a non-global zone. For example, users
in the global zone can view information about every process in the system.
If this capability presents a problem for your site, you can restrict access
to the global zone.</para><para>Each zone, including the global zone, is assigned
a zone name. The global zone always has the name <literal>global</literal>.
Each zone is also given a unique numeric identifier, which is assigned by
the system when the zone is booted. The global zone is always mapped to ID <literal>0</literal>.  Zone names and numeric IDs are discussed in <olink targetptr="z.config.ov-5" remap="internal">Using the zonecfg Command</olink>.</para><para>Each zone also has a node name that is completely independent of the
zone name. The node name is assigned by the administrator of the zone. For
more information, see <olink targetptr="z.admin.ov-11" remap="internal">Non-Global Zone Node
Name</olink>.</para><para>Each zone has a path to its root directory that is relative to the global
zone's root directory. For more information, see <olink targetptr="z.config.ov-5" remap="internal">Using the zonecfg Command</olink>.</para><para>The scheduling class for a non-global zone is set to the scheduling
class for the system by default. See <olink targetptr="gejen" remap="internal">Scheduling Class</olink> for
a discussion of methods used to set the scheduling class in a zone.</para><sect2 id="zones.intro-17"><title>Summary of Zone Features</title><para>The following table summarizes the characteristics of global and

A zone does not need a dedicated CPU, a physical device, or a portion of physical
memory. These resources can either be multiplexed across a number of zones
running within a single domain or system, or allocated on a per-zone basis
using the resource management features available in the operating system.</para><para>Each zone can provide a customized set of services. To enforce basic
process isolation, a process can see or signal only those processes that exist
in the same zone. Basic communication between zones is accomplished by giving
each zone IP network connectivity. An application running in one zone cannot
observe the network traffic of another zone. This isolation is maintained
even though the respective streams of packets travel through the same physical
interface.</para><para>Each zone is given a portion of the file system hierarchy. Because each
zone is confined to its subtree of the file system hierarchy, a  workload
running in a particular zone cannot access the on-disk data  of another workload
running in a different zone.</para><para>Files used by naming services reside within a zone's own root file system
