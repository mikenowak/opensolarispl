</indexterm>You should distribute state database replicas across slices, drives,
and controllers, to  avoid single points of failure. You want a majority of
replicas to survive a  single component failure. If you lose a replica, when
a device fails, for example, the failure might cause problems with running Solaris Volume Manager software
or when rebooting  the system. Solaris Volume Manager software requires at least
half of the replicas to be  available to run, but a majority (half plus one)
to reboot into multiuser  mode.</para>

<title>RAID Volume Naming Conventions for Solaris Live Upgrade</title>
<para>When you use the Solaris Live Upgrade to create RAID-1 volumes (mirrors)
and RAID-0 volumes (submirrors),  you can enable the software to detect and
assign volume names,  or you can assign the names. If you enable the software
 to detect the names, the software assigns the first mirror or submirror name
that  is available. If you assign mirror names, assign names ending in zero
so that the installation can use the names ending in 1 and 2  for submirrors.
If you assign submirror names, assign names ending in 1 or 2. If you assign
numbers incorrectly, the mirror might not  be created. For example, if you
specify a mirror name with a number that  ends in 1 or 2 (<literal>d1</literal> or <literal>d2</literal>), Solaris Live Upgrade fails to create the mirror if the  mirror
name duplicates a submirror's name. </para>

<para>In previous releases, an abbreviated volume name could be entered.
Starting with the Express release, only the full volume name can
