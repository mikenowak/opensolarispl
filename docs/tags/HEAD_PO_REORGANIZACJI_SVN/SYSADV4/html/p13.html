<p>This section presents some of the basic terminology that must be understood
to work with the NFS service. Expanded coverage of the NFS service is included
in <a href="p31.html">Chapter&nbsp;6, Accessing Network File Systems (Reference)</a>.</p>
<a name="rfsintro-5"></a><h4>NFS Servers and Clients</h4>
<p><a name="indexterm-89"></a><a name="indexterm-90"></a><a name="indexterm-91"></a>The terms <b>client</b> and <b>server</b> are
used to describe the roles that a computer assumes when sharing file systems.
Computers that share their file systems over a network are acting as servers.
The computers that are accessing the file systems are said to be clients.
The NFS service enables any computer to access any other computer's file systems.
At the same time, the NFS service provides access to its own file systems.
A computer can assume the role of client, server, or both client and server
at any particular time on a network.</p>
<p>Clients access files on the server by mounting the server's shared file
systems. When a client mounts a remote file system, the client does not make
a copy of the file system. Rather, the mounting process uses a series of remote
procedure calls that enable the client to access the file system transparently
on the server's disk. The mount resembles a local mount. Users type commands
as if the file systems were local. See <a href="p17.html">Mounting File Systems</a> for information about tasks that mount file systems.</p>
<p>After a file system has been shared on a server through an NFS operation,
the file system can be accessed from a client. You can mount an NFS file system
automatically with autofs. See <a href="p15.html#rfsadmin-56">Automatic File-System Sharing</a> and <a href="p22.html#rfsadmin-127">Task Overview for Autofs Administration</a> for tasks that involve the <tt>share</tt> command
and autofs.</p>
<a name="rfsintro-6"></a><h4>NFS File Systems</h4>
<p><a name="indexterm-92"></a><a name="indexterm-93"></a>The objects that can be shared with the NFS service include any
whole or partial directory tree or a file hierarchy, including a single file.
A computer cannot share a file hierarchy that overlaps a file hierarchy that
is already shared. Peripheral devices such as modems and printers cannot be
shared.</p>
<p><a name="indexterm-94"></a><a name="indexterm-95"></a>In most UNIX system environments, a file hierarchy that can be
shared corresponds to a file system or to a portion of a file system. However,
NFS support works across operating systems, and the concept of a file system
might be meaningless in other, non-UNIX environments. Therefore, the term <b>file</b> <b>system</b> refers to a file or file hierarchy
that can be shared and be mounted with NFS.  </p>
<a name="rfsintro-7"></a><h3>About the NFS Service</h3>
<p>The NFS service enables computers of different architectures that run
different operating systems to share file systems across a network. NFS support
has been implemented on many platforms that range from the MS-DOS to the VMS
operating systems. </p>
<p>The NFS environment can be implemented on different operating systems
because NFS defines an abstract model of a file system, rather than an architectural
specification. Each operating system applies the NFS model to its file-system
semantics. This model means that file system operations such as reading and
writing function as though the operations are accessing a local file.</p>
<p>The NFS service has the following benefits: </p>
<ul><li><p>Enables multiple computers to use the same files so that everyone
on the network can access the same data </p>
</li>
<li><p>Reduces storage costs by having computers share applications
instead of needing local disk space for each user application</p>
</li>
<li><p>Provides data consistency and reliability because all users
can read the same set of files</p>
</li>
<li><p>Makes mounting of file systems transparent to users</p>
</li>
<li><p>Makes accessing of remote files transparent to users</p>
</li>
<li><p>Supports heterogeneous environments</p>
</li>
<li><p>Reduces system administration overhead</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The NFS service makes the physical location of the file system irrelevant
to the user. You can use the NFS implementation to enable users to see all
the relevant files regardless of location. Instead of placing copies of commonly
used files on every system, the NFS service enables you to place one copy
on one computer's disk. All other systems access the files across the network.
Under NFS operation, remote file systems are almost indistinguishable from
local file systems.</p>
<a name="rfsintro-19"></a><h3>About Autofs</h3>
<p><a name="indexterm-96"></a><a name="indexterm-97"></a><a name="indexterm-98"></a><a name="indexterm-99"></a><a name="indexterm-100"></a><a name="indexterm-101"></a>File systems that are shared through the NFS service can be mounted
by using automatic mounting. Autofs, a client-side service, is a file-system
structure that provides automatic mounting. The autofs file system is initialized
by <tt>automount</tt>, which is run automatically when a system
is booted. The automount daemon, <tt>automountd</tt>, runs continuously,
mounting and unmounting remote directories as necessary.      </p>
<p>Whenever a client computer that is running <tt>automountd</tt> tries
to access a remote file or remote directory, the daemon mounts the remote
file system. This remote file system remains mounted for as long as needed.
If the remote file system is not accessed for a certain period of time, the
file system is automatically unmounted.</p>
<p><a name="indexterm-102"></a><a name="indexterm-103"></a><a name="indexterm-104"></a><a name="indexterm-105"></a>Mounting need not be done at boot time, and the user no longer
has to know the superuser password to mount a directory. Users do not need
to use the <tt>mount</tt> and <tt>umount</tt> commands.
The autofs service mounts and unmounts file systems as required without any
intervention by the user.    </p>
<p><a name="indexterm-106"></a><a name="indexterm-107"></a><a name="indexterm-108"></a><a name="indexterm-109"></a><a name="indexterm-110"></a><a name="indexterm-111"></a><a name="indexterm-112"></a><a name="indexterm-113"></a><a name="indexterm-114"></a><a name="indexterm-115"></a>Mounting some file hierarchies with <tt>automountd</tt> does
not exclude the possibility of mounting other hierarchies with <tt>mount</tt>.
A diskless computer <b>must</b> mount  <tt>/</tt> (root), <tt>/usr</tt>, and <tt>/usr/kvm</tt> through the <tt>mount</tt> command
and the <tt>/etc/vfstab</tt> file.          </p>
<p><a href="p22.html#rfsadmin-127">Task Overview for Autofs Administration</a> and <a href="p53.html#rfsrefer-75">How Autofs Works</a> give more specific information
about the autofs service.</p>
<a name="rfsintro-101"></a><h3>Features of the NFS Service</h3>
<p>This section describes the important features that are included in the
NFS service. </p>
<a name="rfsintro-8"></a><h4>NFS Version 2 Protocol</h4>
<p>Version 2 was the first version of the NFS protocol in wide use. Version
2 continues to be available on a large variety of platforms. All Solaris releases
support version 2 of the NFS protocol, but Solaris releases prior to Solaris
2.5 support version 2 only. </p>
<a name="rfsintro-9"></a><h4>NFS Version 3 Protocol</h4>
<p>An implementation of NFS version 3 protocol was a new feature of the
Solaris 2.5 release. Several changes have been made to improve interoperability
and performance. For optimal use, the version 3 protocol must be running on
both the NFS servers and clients. </p>
<p>Unlike the NFS version 2 protocol, the NFS version 3 protocol can handle
files that are larger than 2 Gbytes. The previous limitation has been removed.
See <a href="p14.html#rfsintro-13">NFS Large File Support</a>.</p>
<p>The NFS version 3 protocol enables safe asynchronous writes on the server,
which improve performance by allowing the server to cache client write requests
in memory. The client does not need to wait for the server to commit the changes
to disk, so the response time is faster. Also, the server can batch the requests,
which improves the response time on the server.</p>
<p><a name="indexterm-116"></a><a name="indexterm-117"></a><a name="indexterm-118"></a>Many Solaris NFS version 3 operations return the file attributes,
which are stored in the local cache. Because the cache is updated more often,
the need to do a separate operation to update this data arises less often.
Therefore, the number of RPC calls to the server is reduced, improving performance. </p>
<p><a name="indexterm-119"></a><a name="indexterm-120"></a><a name="indexterm-121"></a><a name="indexterm-122"></a><a name="indexterm-123"></a><a name="indexterm-124"></a><a name="indexterm-125"></a><a name="indexterm-126"></a>The process for verifying file access permissions has been improved.
Version 2 generated a &ldquo;write error&rdquo; message  or a &ldquo;read
error&rdquo; message if users tried to copy a remote file without the appropriate
permissions. In version 3, the permissions are checked before the file is
opened, so the error is reported as an &ldquo;open error.&rdquo; </p>
<p>The NFS version 3 protocol removed the 8-Kbyte transfer size limit.
Clients and servers could negotiate whatever transfer size the clients and
servers support, rather than conform to the 8-Kbyte limit that version 2 imposed.
Note that in the Solaris 2.5 implementation, the protocol defaulted to a 32-Kbyte
transfer size. Starting in the Solaris 10 release, restrictions on wire transfer
sizes are relaxed. The transfer size is based on the capabilities of the underlying
transport.</p>
<a name="rfsintro-23"></a><h4>NFS Version 4 Protocol</h4>
<p>NFS version 4 has features that are not available in the previous versions:</p>
<p><a name="indexterm-127"></a>The NFS version 4 protocol represents the user ID and the group
ID as strings. <tt>nfsmapid</tt> is used by the client and the server
to do the following: </p>
<ul><li><p>To map these version 4 ID strings to a local numeric ID</p>
</li>
<li><p>To map the local numeric IDs to version 4 ID strings</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>For more information, refer to <a href="p33.html#rfsrefer-118"><tt>nfsmapid</tt> Daemon</a>.</p>
<p>Note that in NFS version 4, the ID mapper, <tt>nfsmapid</tt>,
is used to map user or group IDs in ACL entries on a server to user or group
IDs in ACL entries on a client. The reverse is also true. For more information,
see <a href="p49.html#gande">ACLs and <tt>nfsmapid</tt> in NFS Version 4</a>.</p>
<p>With NFS version 4, when you unshare a file system, all the state for
any open files or file locks in that file system is destroyed. In NFS version
3 the server maintained any locks that the clients had obtained before the
file system was unshared. For more information, refer to <a href="p48.html#rfsrefer-148">Unsharing and Resharing a File System in NFS Version 4</a>.</p>
<p>NFS version 4 servers use a pseudo file system to provide clients with
access to exported objects on the server. Prior to NFS version 4 a pseudo
file system did not exist. For more information, refer to <a href="p48.html#rfsrefer-136">File-System Namespace in NFS Version 4</a>.</p>
<p>In NFS version 2 and version 3 the server returned persistent file handles.
NFS version 4 supports volatile file handles. For more information, refer
to <a href="p48.html#rfsrefer-137">Volatile File Handles in NFS Version 4</a>.</p>
<p>Delegation, a technique by which the server delegates the management
of a file to a client, is supported on both the client and the server. For
example, the server could grant either a read delegation or a write delegation
to a client. For more information, refer to <a href="p49.html#rfsrefer-140">Delegation in NFS Version 4</a>.</p>
<p>Starting in the Solaris 10 release, NFS version 4 does not support the
LIPKEY/SPKM security flavor.</p>
<p>Also, NFS version 4 does not use the following daemons:</p>
<ul><li><p><tt>mountd</tt></p>
</li>
<li><p><tt>nfslogd</tt></p>
</li>
<li><p><tt>statd</tt></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>For a complete list of the features in NFS version 4, refer to <a href="p48.html">Features in NFS Version 4</a>.</p>
<p>For procedural information that is related to using NFS version 4, refer
