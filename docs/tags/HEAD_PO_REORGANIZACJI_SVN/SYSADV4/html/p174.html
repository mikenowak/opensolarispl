<a name="glossary-1"></a><h3>Glossary</h3>Glossary<a name="glossary-16"></a><b><tt>asppp</tt></b><p>A version of PPP that was included with the Solaris Operating
System from the Solaris 2.4 to the Solaris 8 releases. <tt>asppp</tt> supported
asynchronous PPP communications only.</p>
<a name="glossary-15"></a><b>asynchronous PPP</b><p>A form of PPP that runs over asynchronous serial lines, which
transfer data one character at a time. The most common form of PPP configuration,
the dial-up link, uses asynchronous PPP communications.</p>
<a name="glossary-24"></a><b>authentication</b><p>The act of verifying the identity that is supplied over the
network by a remote user or entity, such as a program. Some authentication
protocols enable you to build databases of authentication credentials from
potential users. Other authentication protocols use certificate chains of
trust that are generated by a certificate authority for authentication purposes.
These credentials can authenticate users when they try to communicate with
you or use your site's services.</p>
<a name="glossary-2"></a><b>broadcast</b><p>A data-link layer procedure that is used to transmit packets
to every machine on a subnet. Broadcast packets are typically not routed beyond
the subnet.</p>
<a name="glossary-40"></a><b>Callback Control Protocol (CBCP)</b><p>A proprietary Microsoft PPP extension that is used to negotiate
a callback session.  Solaris PPP 4.0 supports only the client (initial caller)
side of this protocol.</p>
<a name="glossary-33"></a><b>channel service unit (CSU)</b><p>A synchronous telecommunications device that provides a local
interface to a leased telecommunications line and terminates that line. In
the United States, a CSU terminates a T1 line and provides a DS1 or DSX interface.
Internationally, the CSU is typically owned by the telephone company provider.</p>
<p>See also <a href="p174.html#glossary-22">CSU/DSU</a> and <a href="p174.html#glossary-34">data service unit (DSU)</a>.</p>
<a name="glossary-250"></a><b>CHAP</b><p>The Challenge-Handshake Authentication Protocol is an authentication protocol that can be used to verify the identity of
a caller on a PPP link. CHAP authentication uses the notion of the <b>challenge</b> and <b>response</b>, where the machine that receives
a call challenges the caller to prove its identity. </p>
<p>See also <a href="p174.html#glossary-25">password authentication protocol (PAP)</a>. </p>
<a name="glossary-26"></a><b>CHAP secret</b><p>An ASCII or binary string  that is used for identification
purposes and is known to both peers on a PPP link. The CHAP secret is stored
in clear text in a system's <tt>/etc/ppp/chap-secrets</tt> file
but is never sent over the PPP link, not even in encrypted form. The CHAP
protocol verifies that a hash of the CHAP secret that is used by a caller
matches a hash of the CHAP secret entry for the caller in the recipient's <tt>/etc/ppp/chap-secrets</tt> file.</p>
<a name="glossary-29"></a><b>chat script</b><p>Instructions that tell a modem how to establish a communications
link between itself and a remote peer. Both the PPP and UUCP protocols use
chat scripts for establishing dial-up links and dial-back calling.</p>
<a name="glossary-38"></a><b>Compression Control Protocol (CCP)</b><p>A subprotocol of PPP that negotiates the use of data compression
on the link.  Unlike header compression, CCP compresses all data within packets
that are sent on the link.</p>
<a name="glossary-22"></a><b>CSU/DSU</b><p>A synchronous telecommunications device that combines the
CSU and DSU devices and is used on a leased-line PPP link. The CSU/DSU translates
signals from a peer to a leased line. Most CSU/DSUs do not need a chat script
to establish the link. CSU/DSUs are often configured by the leased-line provider.</p>
<p>See also <a href="p174.html#glossary-33">channel service unit (CSU)</a> and <a href="p174.html#glossary-34">data service unit (DSU)</a>.</p>
<a name="glossary-34"></a><b>data service unit (DSU)</b><p>A synchronous telecommunications device that is used on a
leased-line PPP link. The DSU converts between data-framing formats that are
used on telecommunications lines and provides a standard data communications
interface. </p>
<p>See also <a href="p174.html#glossary-33">channel service unit (CSU)</a> and <a href="p174.html#glossary-22">CSU/DSU</a>.</p>
<a name="glossary-19"></a><b>dial-in server</b><p>The peer that negotiates and establishes the recipient end
of a dial-up PPP link after receiving a call from a dial-out machine. Though
the term &ldquo;dial-in server&rdquo; is in common use, the dial-in server
does not function in accordance with the client-server paradigm. Rather, it
is simply the peer that responds to the request to set up a dial-up link.
After it is configured, a dial-in server can receive calls from any number
of dial-out machines.</p>
<a name="glossary-20"></a><b>dial-out machine</b><p>The peer that initiates the call to establish a dial-up PPP
link. After it is configured, the dial-out machine can call any number of
dial-in servers. The dial-out machine typically provides authentication credentials
before the dial-up link can be established.</p>
<a name="glossary-18"></a><b>dial-up PPP link</b><p>A PPP connection that involves a peer and a modem at either
end of a telephone line or similar communications medium, such as a medium
that is provided by ISDN. The term &ldquo;dial-up&rdquo; refers to the sequence
in link negotiation when the local modem dials up the remote peer by using
the peer's telephone number. The dial-up link is the most common and least
expensive PPP configuration.</p>
<a name="glossary-3"></a><b>Directory Agent (DA)</b><p>Optional SLP agent that stores and maintains a cache of service
advertisements that are sent by the service agent (SA). When deployed, the
DA resolves user agent (UA) service requests. The DA responds to active solicitations
from the SA and UA for directory advertisements. As a result, the SA and UA
discover the associated DAs and <b>scopes</b>. A DA sends periodic
unsolicited advertisements through which UAs and SAs discover the DA within
shared scopes.</p>
<a name="glossary-32"></a><b>expect-send</b><p>A scripting format that is used in PPP and UUCP chat scripts.
The chat script begins with the text or instruction to <b>expect</b> from
the remote peer. The next line contains the response to be <b>sent</b> from
the local host after it receives the correct expect string from the peer.
Subsequent lines repeat the expect-send instructions between local host and
peer until all instructions that are required to establish communications
are successfully negotiated.</p>
<a name="glossary-45"></a><b>extended accounting</b><p>A flexible way to record resource consumption on a task or
process basis in the Solaris Operating System.</p>
<a name="glossary-36"></a><b>Internet Protocol Control Protocol
(IPCP)</b><p>A subprotocol of PPP that negotiates the IP addresses of the
peers on the link. IPCP also negotiates header compression for the link and
enables the use of the network layer protocols.</p>
<a name="glossary-37"></a><b>Internet Protocol Version 6 Control
Protocol (IPV6CP)</b><p>See <a href="p174.html#glossary-36">Internet Protocol Control Protocol (IPCP)</a>.</p>
<a name="glossary-21"></a><b>ISDN terminal adaptor (TA)</b><p>A signal-adapting device that provides a modem-like interface
for a dial-up PPP link over an ISDN network. You use the same Solaris PPP
4.0 configuration files to configure an ISDN TA as you use for configuring
a standard modem.</p>
<a name="glossary-23"></a><b>leased-line PPP link</b><p>A PPP connection that involves a host and a CSU/DSU that are
connected to a synchronous network medium leased from a provider. OC3 and
T1 are common examples of leased-line media. Though easier to administer,
leased-line links are more expensive than dial-up PPP links and, therefore,
are less common.</p>
<a name="glossary-4"></a><b>legacy services</b><p>A networked service that is not SLP-enabled. You can create
a proxy registration to register a legacy service with SLP. SLP-based clients
can then discover legacy services (see <a href="p67.html">Chapter&nbsp;10, Incorporating Legacy Services</a>).</p>
<a name="glossary-17"></a><b>link</b><p>In PPP, the communications connection that is negotiated and
established between two peers. Solaris PPP 4.0 supports two types of links:
dial up and leased line.</p>
<a name="glossary-35"></a><b>link control protocol (LCP)</b><p>A subprotocol of PPP that is used to negotiate the initial
set of link parameters between the peers.  Part of the function of LCP is
to test the link integrity, so many link-related problems manifest themselves
as LCP failure.</p>
<a name="glossary-39"></a><b>Microsoft CHAP (MS-CHAP)</b><p>A proprietary Microsoft authentication protocol for PPP. Solaris
PPP 4.0 supports versions 1 and 2 of this protocol in both client and server
mode.</p>
<a name="glossary-5"></a><b>multicast</b><p>A network layer procedure that is used to send datagram packets
to multiple machines on an IP network. Packets are not handled by every machine
as is the situation with broadcast routing. Multicast requires that routers
be configured with special routing protocols.</p>
<a name="glossary-25"></a><b>password authentication protocol (PAP)</b><p>An authentication protocol that can be used to verify the
identity of a caller on a PPP link. PAP uses a cleartext password that is
passed over the link, which makes it possible to store the password on one
of the endpoint machines. For example, PAP can use the login and password
entries in the UNIX <tt>passwd</tt> database on the machine that
receives a call to verify the identity of the caller.</p>
<p>See also <a href="p174.html#glossary-250">CHAP</a>.</p>
<a name="glossary-13"></a><b>peer</b><p>In PPP, an individual computer at one end of a PPP communications
link, which consists of two peers that are connected by communications media.
You can configure many types of computing equipment as a peer, such as a workstation,
personal computer, router, or mainframe.</p>
<a name="glossary-14"></a><b>point-to-point protocol (PPP)</b><p>A data-link layer protocol that provides a standard method
for transferring datagrams over point-to-point media. A PPP configuration
consists of two endpoint computers called <b>peers</b>, and
the telephone lines or another bidirectional link that the peers use for communication.
The hardware and software connection between the two peers is considered the <b>PPP link</b>. </p>
<p>PPP is composed of a number of subprotocols,
including PAP, CHAP, LCP, and CCP. Numerous PPP implementations are available.
The Solaris 9 Operating System includes Solaris PPP 4.0. </p>
<a name="glossary-27"></a><b>PPP over Ethernet (PPPoE)</b><p>A proprietary protocol from RedBack Networks that enables
hosts to run PPP sessions over an Ethernet link. PPPoE is commonly used with
Digital Subscriber Line (DSL) services.</p>
<a name="glossary-6"></a><b>scope</b><p>A grouping of UAs and SAs that are arranged administratively,
topologically, or in some other manner. You can use scopes to modify how you
provision access to services across the enterprise.</p>
<a name="glossary-7"></a><b>service advertisements</b><p>Information that is distributed by an SA that describes a
service. A service advertisement consists of a URL and a collection of attribute/value
list pairs that describe a service. All service advertisements have a lifetime.
After the lifetime expires, a service advertisement is no longer valid unless
reregistered.</p>
<a name="glossary-8"></a><b>Service Agent (SA)</b><p>The SLP agent that maintains service advertisements for networked
services. If no DA is available, the SA answers multicast service requests
from UAs. If a DA is available, the SA registers and, optionally, deregisters
services with DAs that support its scopes.</p>
<a name="glossary-9"></a><b>service URL</b><p>A URL that is used to advertise the network location of services.
The URL contains the service type, host name, or network address of the service
host. The URL might also contain a port number and other information that
is required to use the service.</p>
<a name="glossary-10"></a><b>SLP daemon (slpd)</b><p>The daemon process that acts as a DA or an SA server in the
Solaris implementation of SLP. Service processes on the host register service
advertisements with <tt>slpd</tt> instead of maintaining the advertisements
individually. Each process contains an SA client library that communicates
with <tt>slpd</tt> when the daemon is configured as the SA server.
The SLP daemon forwards all registrations and deregistrations to DAs. The
daemon times out expired service advertisements and maintains a table of the
available DAs by performing active and passive DA discovery. Through such
mechanisms, DA information is provided to UA clients. UA clients use <tt>slpd</tt> on a host only for DA information. You can optionally configure <tt>slpd</tt> as a DA.</p>
<a name="glossary-150"></a><b>synchronous PPP</b><p>A form of PPP that runs over synchronous digital lines, which
transfer data as a continuous stream of raw bits. The leased-line PPP link
uses synchronous PPP.</p>
<a name="glossary-31"></a><b>trusted callers</b><p>In PPP, remote peers that a dial-in server grants access to
by including the peers' security credentials in the server's PAP or CHAP secrets
database.</p>
<a name="glossary-11"></a><b>User Agent (UA)</b><p>The SLP agent that acts on behalf of the user application.
The agent queries for the identity of corresponding scopes, directory agents,
and service advertisements.</p>
