</question><answer><para>On the server, use <literal>snoop</literal> or another application for
capturing network packets. See <olink targetptr="dhcp-trouble-proc-21" remap="internal">How to Use
snoop to Monitor DHCP Network Traffic</olink>. In the <literal>snoop</literal> output,
look for the <literal>FQDN</literal> option in a packet from the client.</para><para>Configure the client to specify host name using <literal>Hostname</literal> option. <literal>Hostname</literal> is option code 12. Refer to client documentation for instructions.</para><para>For a Solaris client, see <olink targetptr="dhcp-admin-1058sm" remap="internal">How to
Enable a Solaris Client to Request a Specific Host Name</olink></para>

the client's DNS domain.</para>
</question><answer><para>On the DHCP server look for the <literal>DNSdmain</literal> option with
a valid value. Set the <literal>DNSdmain</literal> option to the correct DNS domain
name in a macro that is processed for this client. <literal>DNSdmain</literal> is
usually contained in the network macro. See <olink targetptr="dhcp-admin-18" remap="internal">Modifying
DHCP Macros</olink> for information about changing values of options in a macro.</para>

</qandaentry><qandaentry><question><para>The host name requested by client corresponds to an IP address that
is not managed by the DHCP server. The Solaris DHCP server does not perform DNS updates
for IP addresses that the server does not manage.</para>
</question><answer><para>Check <literal>syslog</literal> for one of the following messages from
the DHCP server:</para><itemizedlist><listitem><para><literal>There is no</literal> <replaceable>n.n.n.n</replaceable> <literal>dhcp-network table for DHCP client's network.</literal></para>
</listitem><listitem><para><literal>DHCP network record for</literal> <replaceable>n.n.n.n</replaceable> <literal>is unavailable, ignoring request.</literal></para>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist><para>Configure the client to request a different name. See <olink targetptr="dhcp-admin-1058sm" remap="internal">How to Enable a Solaris Client to Request a Specific Host Name</olink>. Choose a name
that is mapped to an address managed by the DHCP server. You can see address mappings
in DHCP Manager's Addresses tab. Alternatively, choose an address that is not mapped
to any IP address.</para>
</answer>
</qandaentry><qandaentry><question><para>The host name requested by client corresponds to an IP address that
is currently not available for use. The address might be in use, leased to another
client, or under offer to another client.</para>
</question><answer><para>Check <literal>syslog</literal> for the following message from the DHCP
server: <literal>ICMP ECHO reply to OFFER candidate:</literal> <replaceable>n.n.n.n</replaceable>.</para><para>Configure the client to choose a name corresponding to
a different IP address. Alternatively, reclaim the address from the client that uses
the address.</para>

</qandaentry><qandaentry><question><para>DNS server is not configured to accept updates from the DHCP server.</para>
</question><answer><para>Examine the <literal>/etc/named.conf</literal> file on the DNS server.
Look for the DHCP server's IP address with the <literal>allow-update</literal> keyword
in the appropriate <literal>zone</literal> section for the DHCP server's domain. If
the IP address is not present, the DNS server is not configured to accept updates
from the DHCP server.</para><para>See <olink targetptr="dhcp-admin-303" remap="internal">How to Enable
Dynamic DNS Updating for DHCP Clients</olink> for information about configuring the
DNS server.</para><para>If the DHCP server has multiple interfaces, you might need
to configure the DNS server to accept updates from all of the DHCP server's addresses.
Enable debugging on the DNS server to see whether the updates are reaching the DNS
server. If the DNS server received update requests, examine the debugging mode output
to determine why the updates did not occur. See the <command>in.named</command>.1M
man page for information about DNS debugging mode.</para>
</answer>
</qandaentry><qandaentry><question><para>DNS updates might not have completed in the allotted time. DHCP servers
do not return host names to clients if the DNS updates have not completed by the configured
time  limit. However, attempts to complete the DNS updates continue.</para>
</question><answer><para>Use the <literal>nslookup</literal> command to determine whether the
updates completed successfully. See the <olink targetdoc="refman1m" targetptr="nslookup-1m" remap="external"><citerefentry><refentrytitle>nslookup</refentrytitle><manvolnum>1M</manvolnum></citerefentry></olink> man
page.</para><para>For example, suppose the DNS domain is <literal>hills.example.org</literal>, and the DNS server's IP address is <literal>10.76.178.11</literal>. The
host name that the client wants to register is <literal>cathedral</literal>. You could
use the following command to determine if <literal>cathedral</literal> has been registered
with that DNS server:</para><para><literal>nslookup cathedral.hills.example.org 10.76.178.11</literal></para><para>If the updates completed successfully, but not in the allotted
time, you need to increase the time out value. See <olink targetptr="dhcp-admin-303" remap="internal">How to Enable Dynamic DNS Updating for DHCP Clients</olink>. In this procedure, you
should increase the number of seconds to wait for a response from the DNS server before
timing out.</para>
