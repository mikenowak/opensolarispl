on the <emphasis>service-level agreement</emphasis> (SLA) that your company
offers to its customers. In an SLA, a service provider guarantees to a customer
a certain level of network service that is based on a price structure. For
example, a premium-priced SLA might ensure that the customer receives highest
priority for all types of network traffic 24 hours per day. Conversely, a
medium-priced SLA might guarantee that the customer receives high priority
for email only during business hours. All other traffic would receive medium
priority  24 hours a day. </para>

</sect1><sect1 id="ipqos-intro-90"><title>Improving Network Efficiency With IPQoS</title><para>IPQoS contains features that can help you make network performance
more efficient as you implement quality of service. When computer networks
expand, the need also increases for managing network traffic that is generated
by increasing numbers of users and more powerful processors. Some symptoms
of an overused network include lost data and traffic congestion. Both symptoms
result in slow response times. </para><para>In the past, system administrators handled network traffic problems
by adding more bandwidth. Often, the level of traffic on the links varied
widely. With IPQoS, you can manage traffic on the existing network and help
assess where, and whether, expansion is necessary. </para><para>For example, for an enterprise or institution, you must maintain an
efficient network to avoid traffic bottlenecks. You must also ensure that
a group or application does not consume more than its allotted bandwidth.
For an ISP or ASP, you must manage network performance to ensure that customers
receive their paid-for level of network service.</para><sect2 id="ipqos-intro-25"><title>How Bandwidth Affects Network Traffic</title><para>You can use IPQoS to regulate network <emphasis>bandwidth</emphasis>,
the maximum amount of data that a fully used network link or device can transfer.
Your QoS policy should prioritize the use of bandwidth to provide quality
of service to customers or users. The IPQoS metering modules enable you to
measure and control bandwidth allocation among the various traffic classes
on an IPQoS-enabled host.</para><para>Before you can effectively manage traffic on your network, you must

</sect2><sect2 id="ipqos-intro-70"><title>Using Classes of Service to Prioritize Traffic</title><para>To implement quality of service, you analyze
network traffic to determine any broad groupings into which the traffic can
be divided. Then, you organize the various groupings into classes of service
with individual characteristics and individual priorities. These classes form
the basic categories on which you base the QoS policy for your organization.
The classes of service represent the traffic groups that you want to control.</para><para>For example, a provider might offer platinum, gold, silver, and
bronze levels of service, available at a sliding price structure. A platinum
SLA might guarantee top priority to incoming traffic that is destined for
a web site that the ISP hosts for the customer. Thus, incoming traffic to
the customer's web site could be one traffic class.</para><para>For an enterprise, you could create classes of service that are based
on department requirements. Or, you could create classes that are  based on
the preponderance of a particular application in the network traffic. Here
are a few examples of traffic classes for an enterprise:</para><itemizedlist><listitem><para>Popular applications such as email and outgoing FTP to a particular
server, either of which could constitute a class. Because employees constantly
use these applications, your QoS policy might guarantee email and outgoing
FTP a small amount of bandwidth and a lower priority.</para>
</listitem><listitem><para>An order-entry database that needs to run 24 hours a day.
Depending on the importance of the database application to the enterprise,
you might give the database a large amount of bandwidth and a high priority.</para>

</sect1><sect1 id="ipqos-intro-54"><title>Traffic Forwarding on an IPQoS-Enabled Network</title><para>This section introduces the elements that are involved in forwarding
packets on an IPQoS-enabled network. An IPQoS-enabled system handles any packets
on the network stream with the system's IP address as the destination. The
IPQoS system then applies its QoS policy to the packet to establish differentiated
services.</para><sect2 id="ipqos-intro-99"><title>DS Codepoint</title><para>The DS codepoint (DSCP) defines in the packet header the action
that any Diffserv-aware system should take on a marked packet. The diffserv
architecture defines a set of DS codepoints for the IPQoS-enabled system and
diffserv router to use. The Diffserv architecture also defines a set of  actions
that are called <emphasis>forwarding behaviors</emphasis>, which correspond
to the DSCPs. The IPQoS-enabled system marks the precedence bits of the DS
field in the packet header with the DSCP. When a router receives a packet
with a DSCP value, the router applies the forwarding behavior that is associated
with that DSCP. The packet is then released onto the network. </para><note><para>The <command>dlcosmk</command> marker does not use the DSCP. Rather, <command>dlcosmk</command> marks Ethernet frame headers with a CoS value. If you plan

defines the forwarding precedence that a marked packet receives in relation
to other traffic on the Diffserv-aware system. This precedence ultimately
determines whether the IPQoS-enabled system or Diffserv router forwards or
drops the marked packet. For a forwarded packet, each Diffserv router that
the packet encounters en route to its destination applies the same PHB. The
exception is if another Diffserv system changes the DSCP. For more information
on PHBs, refer to <olink targetptr="ipqos-reference-330" remap="internal">Using the dscpmk
Marker for Forwarding Packets</olink>.</para><para>The goal of a PHB is to provide a specified amount of network resources
to a class of traffic on the contiguous network. You can achieve this goal
in the QoS policy. Define DSCPs that indicate the precedence levels for traffic
classes when the traffic flows leave the IPQoS-enabled system. Precedences
can  range from high-precedence/low-drop probability to low-precedence/high-drop
probability. </para><para>For example, your QoS policy can assign to one class of traffic a DSCP
that guarantees a low-drop PHB. This traffic class then receives a low-drop
precedence PHB from any Diffserv-aware router, which guarantees bandwidth
to packets of this class. You can add to the QoS policy other DSCPs that assign
varying levels of precedence to other traffic classes. The lower-precedence
packets are given bandwidth by Diffserv systems in agreement with the priorities
that are indicated in the packets' DSCPs.</para><para>IPQoS supports two types of forwarding behaviors, which are defined
in the Diffserv architecture, expedited forwarding and assured forwarding. </para><sect3 id="ipqos-intro-100"><title>Expedited Forwarding</title><para>The <emphasis>expedited forwarding (EF)</emphasis> per-hop behavior
assures that any traffic class with EFs related DSCP is given highest priority.
 Traffic with an EF DSCP is not queued. EF provides low loss, latency, and
jitter. The recommended DSCP for EF is 101110. A packet that is marked with
101110 receives guaranteed low-drop precedence as the packet traverses Diffserv-aware
networks en route to its destination. Use the EF DSCP when assigning priority
to customers or applications with a premium SLA.</para>
</sect3><sect3 id="ipqos-intro-110"><title>Assured Forwarding</title><para>The <emphasis>assured forwarding (AF)</emphasis> per-hop behavior
provides four different forwarding classes that you can assign to a packet.
Every forwarding class provides three drop precedences, as shown in <olink targetptr="ipqos-reference-tbl-16" remap="internal">Table 37&#8211;2</olink>. </para><para>The various AF codepoints provide the ability to assign different levels
of service to customers and applications. In the QoS policy,  you can prioritize
traffic and services  on your network when you plan the QoS policy. You can
then assign different AF levels to the prioritized traffic.</para>
