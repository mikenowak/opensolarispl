</indexterm>Before you create and install a Solaris Flash archive, you must make
some decisions about how you want to install the Solaris OS on your systems. The first
time that you install a system, you install with a full archive that is an initial
installation. After a system has been installed with an archive, the system can be
updated with a differential archive. The differential archive installs only the differences
between two archives. </para>

<para>The first task in the Solaris Flash installation process is to install
a system, the master system, with the configuration that you want each of the clone
systems to have. You can use any of the Solaris installation methods to install an
archive on the master system. The installation can be a subset or a complete installation
of the Solaris OS. After you complete the installation, you can add or remove software
or modify any configuration files. Some limitations to installing the master system
are the following:</para>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<para>The master system and the clone systems must have the same kernel
architectures. For example, you  can only  use an archive that was created from a
master system that has a <literal>sun4u</literal> architecture  to install clones
with a <literal>sun4u</literal> architecture. </para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>You must install the master system with the exact configuration that
you want on each of the clone systems. The decisions that you make when you design
the installation of the master system depend on the following:</para>

<para>Modify configuration files. You can alter configuration files on the

are saved as part of the Solaris Flash archive and are installed on the clone
systems.</para>

you can exclude large data files that you might not want in the archive. For an overview,

<title>Creating Solaris Flash Archives With RAID-1 Volumes</title>
<para>Starting in the Solaris 9 9/04 release, you can create and install Solaris Flash archives
created from a master system that has RAID-1 volumes configured.  With the Solaris
9 12/03 and Solaris 9 4/04 release, you must install a patch.  To get a the patch
that fixes CR 4838219, see <link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:type="text" xlink:href="http://sunsolve.sun.com">sunsolve.sun.com</link>.</para>
<para>You can create a Solaris Flash archive when you have Solaris Volume Manager RAID-1
volumes configured.  The Solaris Flash creation software removes all RAID-1 volume
information from the archive to keep the integrity of the clone system.  With custom
JumpStart you can rebuild the RAID-1 volumes by using a JumpStart profile.  With Solaris
Live Upgrade, you create a boot environment with RAID-1 volumes configured and install
the archive.  The Solaris installation program cannot be used to install RAID-1 volumes
with a Solaris Flash archive.</para>

<note>

<para>Veritas VxVM stores configuration information in areas not available to Solaris Flash.
 If Veritas VxVm file systems have been configured, you should not create a Solaris Flash archive.
 Also, Solaris install, including JumpStart and Solaris Live Upgrade do not support
rebuilding VxVM volumes at installation time. Therefore, if you are planning to deploy
Veritas VxVM software using a Solaris Flash archive, the archive must be created
prior to configuring the VxVM file systems.  The clone systems must be then configured
individually after the archive has been applied and the system rebooted.</para>

</indexterm>When you create a Solaris Flash archive, some files and directories
that are to be copied from the master system can be excluded. If you have excluded
a directory, you can also restore specified files or subdirectories under that directory.
For example, you could create an archive that excludes all files and directories in <filename>/a/aa/bb/c</filename>. The  content of the <filename>bb</filename> subdirectory could
be included. The only content would  then be in the <filename>bb</filename> subdirectory.</para>
<caution>

<para>Use the <command>flarcreate</command> file-exclusion options with caution. If you exclude some directories, others
that you were unaware of might be left in the archive, such as system configuration
files. The system would then be inconsistent and the installation would not work.
Excluding directories and files is best used with data that can easily be removed
without disrupting the system, such as large data files.</para>
