<a class="indexterm" name="indexterm-275"></a>
<p>The security administrator agrees that the set of labels that are mandated
by the legal department is a useful starting point. However, the further analysis
is needed before the labels can be encoded.</p>
<div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="planex-8"></a>Requirements for <code class="literal">CONFIDENTIAL: INTERNAL_USE_ONLY</code>
</h3></div></div></div>

<a class="indexterm" name="indexterm-276"></a>
<a class="indexterm" name="indexterm-277"></a>
<p>The <code class="literal">CONFIDENTIAL: INTERNAL_USE_ONLY</code> label is for
information that is proprietary to the company but which, because of its low
level of sensitivity, can be distributed to all employees. All employees have
signed nondisclosure agreements before starting employment. Information with
this label might also be distributed to others. For example, the employees
of vendors and contractors who have signed a nondisclosure agreement can receive
the information. Because the Internet can be snooped, information with this
label cannot be sent over the Internet. The information can be sent over email
within the company.</p>
<div class="itemizedlist"><p>Candidates for the <code class="literal">CONFIDENTIAL: INTERNAL_USE_ONLY</code> label
include the following:</p><ul type="disc"><li>
<p>Spending guidelines</p>
</li><li>
<p>Internal job postings</p>
</li></ul></div>
</div>
<div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="planex-9"></a>Requirements for <code class="literal">CONFIDENTIAL: NEED_TO_KNOW</code>
</h3></div></div></div>

<a class="indexterm" name="indexterm-278"></a>
<a class="indexterm" name="indexterm-279"></a>
<p>The <code class="literal">CONFIDENTIAL: NEED_TO_KNOW</code> label is intended
for information that is proprietary to the company, has a higher level of
sensitivity than <code class="literal">INTERNAL_USE_ONLY</code>, and has a more limited
audience. Distribution is limited to employees who need to know the information.
Other people who need to know the information and who have signed nondisclosure
agreements might also be in the audience.</p>
<p>For example, if only the group of people working in a particular project
should see certain information, then <code class="literal">NEED_TO_KNOW</code> should
be used on that information. Whenever information should be restricted to
a particular group, the name of the group should be specified on the paper
version of the information.</p>
<p>Having the name of a group in this label makes it clear that the information
should not be given to anyone outside of the group. Information with this
label cannot be sent over the Internet but it can be sent over email within
the company.</p>
<div class="itemizedlist"><p>Candidates for the <code class="literal">NEED_TO_KNOW</code> label include the
following:</p><ul type="disc"><li>
<p>Product design documents</p>
</li><li>
<p>Project details</p>
</li><li>
<p>Employee Status Change form</p>
</li></ul></div>

<div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="planex-10"></a>Requirements for <code class="literal">CONFIDENTIAL: REGISTERED</code>
</h3></div></div></div>

<a class="indexterm" name="indexterm-280"></a>
<a class="indexterm" name="indexterm-281"></a>
<p>The <code class="literal">CONFIDENTIAL: REGISTERED</code> classification is intended
for information that is proprietary to the company, has a very high level
of sensitivity, and could significantly harm the company if released. Registered
information must be numbered and be tracked by the owner. Each copy must be
assigned to a specific person. The copy must be returned to the owner for
destruction after being read. Copies can be made only by the owner of the
information. Use of brownish-red paper is recommended because this color cannot
be copied.</p>
<p>This label is to be used when only one specific group of people should
be allowed to see the proprietary information. This information cannot be
shown to anyone who is not authorized by the owner. The information cannot
be shown to employees of other companies who have not signed a nondisclosure
agreement, even if the owner authorizes the disclosure. Information with this
label cannot be sent through email.</p>
<div class="itemizedlist"><p>Candidates for the <code class="literal">CONFIDENTIAL: REGISTERED</code> label
include the following:</p><ul type="disc"><li>
<p>End of quarter financial information that has not yet been
released</p>
</li><li>
<p>Sales forecasts</p>
</li><li>
<p>Marketing forecasts</p>

<div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="planex-21"></a>Names of Groups With <code class="literal">NEED_TO_KNOW</code> Label</h3></div></div></div>

<a class="indexterm" name="indexterm-282"></a>
<div class="itemizedlist"><p>The security administrator decided that the <code class="literal">NEED_TO_KNOW</code> label
should contain the names of groups or departments. The security Administrator
asked for suggestions about what words to use to define groups or areas of
interest within the organization. The following items were in the initial
list:</p><ul type="disc"><li>
<p>Engineering</p>
</li><li>
<p>Executive Management</p>
</li><li>
<p>Finance</p>
</li><li>
<p>Human Resources</p>
</li><li>
<p>Legal</p>
</li><li>
<p>Manufacturing</p>
</li><li>
<p>Marketing</p>
</li><li>
<p>Sales</p>
</li><li>
<p>System Administration</p>
</li></ul></div>
<p>Later, the security administrator added the Project Team group, which
enabled all members of the Engineering and Marketing groups to share project
data.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="planex-21281"></a>Understanding the Set of Labels</h3></div></div></div>

<div class="itemizedlist"><p>The next step is to resolve the following issues:</p><ul type="disc"><li>
<p>How to use the classifications and compartments to encode
the labels and clearances</p>
</li><li>
<p>Which handling instructions should appear on printed output</p>
</li></ul></div>
<p>The security administrator used a large board. Pieces of paper were
marked with the words that should be in the labels, as shown in <span class="olink">Figure 6&#8211;5</span>. This setup graphed the
relationships. The pieces could be rearranged until all the pieces fit together.</p>
<div class="itemizedlist"><p>The administrator drafted the following label relationships:</p><ul type="disc"><li>
<p>The four labels are hierarchical with the label that contains <code class="literal">REGISTERED</code> the highest. The <code class="literal">PUBLIC</code> label is the
lowest.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Only one label needs to be associated with group names</p>
<p>The list of people who are cleared to receive registered information
is limited on a case by case basis. Therefore, <code class="literal">REGISTERED</code> does
not need any group names. <code class="literal">INTERNAL_USE_ONLY</code> applies to
all employees and people who have signed nondisclosure agreements and <code class="literal">PUBLIC</code> labels are for everybody. Therefore, <code class="literal">INTERNAL_USE_ONLY</code> and <code class="literal">PUBLIC</code> labels do not need further qualification. The <code class="literal">NEED_TO_KNOW</code> label does need to be associated with non-hierarchical words, such
as <code class="literal">NEED_TO_KNOW MARKETING</code> or <code class="literal">NEED_TO_KNOW ENGINEERING</code>. The words that identify the group or department can also be included
in a user's clearance, as part of establishing that user's need to know.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Each of the labels except <code class="literal">PUBLIC</code> requires
the person who is accessing the information to have signed a nondisclosure
agreement.</p>
<p>A phrase such as <code class="literal">NON-DISCLOSURE AGREEMENT
REQUIRED</code> would be a good reminder that this requirement exists.</p>
</li><li>
<p>The handling instructions on banner and trailer pages should
have clear wording on how to handle the information. How to handle the information
is based on the classification and on any group name that can appear in the
label.</p>
<p>Along with information on the sensitivity of the printer
output, handling instructions should print that a nondisclosure agreement
is required when the label requires such an agreement.</p>
