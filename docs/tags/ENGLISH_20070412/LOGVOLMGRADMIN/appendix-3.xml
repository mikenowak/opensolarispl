<title>Managing Solaris Volume Manager</title>
<para>The Solaris Volume Manager CIM/WBEM Application Programming Interface
(API) provides a public, standards-based programmatic interface to observe
and configure Solaris Volume Manager. This API is based on the Distributed
Management Task Force (DMTF) Common Information Model (CIM). For more information
about  DMTF, see <literal>http://www.dmtf.org</literal>. </para>
<para>CIM defines the data model, referred to as the “schema“
which describes the following:</para>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<para>Attributes of and the operations against Solaris Volume Manager devices</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>Relationships among the various Solaris Volume Manager devices</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>Relationships among the Solaris Volume Manager devices and other aspects
          of the operating system, such as file systems </para>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<para>This model is made available through the Solaris Web Based Enterprise
Management (WBEM) SDK. The WBEM SDK is a set of <trademark>Java</trademark> technology-based
API's that allow access to system management capabilities that are represented
by CIM.</para>
