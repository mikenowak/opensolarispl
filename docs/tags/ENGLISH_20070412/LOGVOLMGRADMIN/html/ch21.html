<p>Distributed computing environments, often need to deploy similar or identical
servers at multiple locations. These environments include ISPs, geographically distributed
sales offices, and telecommunication service providers. Servers in a distributed computing
environment might provide some of the following services:</p>
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li>
<p>Router or firewall services</p>
</li><li>
<p>Email services</p>
</li><li>
<p>DNS caches</p>
</li><li>
<p>Usenet (Network News) servers</p>
</li><li>
<p>DHCP services</p>
</li><li>
<p>Other services best provided at a variety of locations</p>
</li></ul></div>
<p>These small servers have several characteristics in common:</p>
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li>
<p>High-reliability requirements</p>
</li><li>
<p>High-availability requirements</p>
</li><li>
<p>Routine hardware and performance requirements</p>
</li></ul></div>
<p>As a starting point, consider a <span class="trademark">Netra</span>&#8482; server with a single
SCSI bus and two internal disks. This off-the-shelf configuration is a good starting
point for distributed servers. Solaris Volume Manager could easily be used to mirror
some or all of the slices, thus providing redundant storage to help guard against
disk failure. See the following figure for an example of this small system configuration.</p>
<div class="figure"><a name="best-practices-fig-4"></a><p class="title"><b>Figure 21.1. Small System Configuration</b></p>


<div class="mediaobject"><img src="../figures/best-practices-sm-sys-1.gif" alt="Small System Configuration" longdesc="ld-id1773075.html"><div class="longdesc-link" align="right"><br clear="all"><span class="longdesc-link">[<a href="ld-id1773075.html" target="longdesc">D</a>]</span></div></div>
</div>
<p>This configuration might include mirrors for the root (<code class="literal">/</code>), <code class="literal">/usr</code>, <code class="literal">swap</code>, <code class="literal">/var</code>, and <code class="literal">/export</code> file systems, plus state database replicas (one per disk). As such, a failure
of either side of any of the mirrors would not necessarily result in system failure.
Also, up to five discrete failures could possibly be tolerated. However, the system
is not sufficiently protected against disk or slice failure. A variety of potential
failures could result in a complete system failure, requiring operator intervention. </p>
<p>While this configuration does help provide some protection against catastrophic
disk failure, it exposes key possible single points of failure:</p>
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li>
<p>The single SCSI controller represents a potential point of failure.
If the controller fails, the system is down, pending replacement of the part. </p>
</li><li>
<p>The two disks do not provide adequate distribution of state database
replicas. The majority consensus algorithm requires that half of the state database
replicas be available for the system to continue to run. This algorithm also requires
half plus one replica for a reboot. So, if one state database replica were on each
disk and one disk or the slice that contains the replica failed, the system could
not reboot. As a result a mirrored root (<code class="filename">/</code>) file system would
become ineffective. If two or more state database replicas were on each disk, a single
slice failure would likely not be problematic. However, a disk failure would still
prevent a reboot. If different number of replicas were on each disk, one disk would
have more than half and one disk would have fewer than half. If the disk with fewer
replicas failed, the system could reboot and continue. However, if the disk with more
replicas failed, the system would immediately panic. </p>
</li></ul></div>
<p>A &#8220;Best Practices&#8221; approach would be to modify the configuration
by adding one more controller and one more hard drive. The resulting configuration
would be far more resilient. </p>
