<p>Solaris Volume Manager can <span class="emphasis"><em>replace</em></span> and <span class="emphasis"><em>enable</em></span> components
within RAID-1 (mirror) and RAID-5 volumes. </p>
<p>In Solaris Volume Manager terminology, <span class="emphasis"><em>replacing</em></span> a component
is a way to substitute an available component on the system for a selected
component in a submirror or RAID-5 volume. You can think of this process as
logical replacement, as opposed to physically replacing the component. For
more information see <span class="olink">Replacing a Component With Another Available Component</span>.</p>
<p>
<span class="emphasis"><em>Enabling</em></span> a component means to &#8220;activate&#8221;
or substitute a component with itself (that is, the component name is the
same). For more information, see <span class="olink">Enabling a Component</span>.</p>

<p>
<a class="indexterm" name="indexterm-210"></a>When recovering from disk errors, scan <code class="filename">/var/adm/messages</code> to
see what kind of errors occurred. If the errors are transitory and the disks
themselves do not have problems, try enabling the failed components. You can
also use the <span><strong class="command">format</strong></span> command to test a disk. </p>
</div>
<div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="replace-enable-2"></a>Enabling a Component</h3></div></div></div>

<p>You can enable a component when any of the following conditions exist:</p>
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li>
<p>Solaris Volume Manager cannot access the physical drive. This problem
might occur, for example, due to a power loss, or a loose drive cable. In
this case, Solaris Volume Manager puts the components in the &#8220;Maintenance&#8221;
state. You need to make sure that the drive is accessible (restore power,
reattach cables, and so on), and then enable the components in the volumes.</p>
</li><li>
<p>You suspect that a physical drive is having transitory problems
that are not disk-related. You might be able to fix a component in the &#8220;Maintenance&#8221;
state by simply enabling it. If enabling the component does not fix the problem,
then you need to do one of the following:</p>
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="circle"><li>
<p>Physically replace the disk drive and enable the component</p>
</li><li>
<p>Replace the component with another available component on
the system</p>
</li></ul></div>
<p>When you physically replace a disk, be sure to partition the disk like
the replaced disk to ensure adequate space on each used component.</p>
</li></ul></div>
<div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Note</h3>

<p>Always check for state database replicas and hot spares on the
disk that is being replaced. Any state database replica in an erred state
should be deleted before you replace the disk. Then, after you enable the
component, recreate the state database replicas using the same size. You should
treat hot spares in the same manner.</p>

<div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="replace-enable-3"></a>Replacing a Component With Another Available
Component</h3></div></div></div>

<p>You use the <span><strong class="command">metareplace</strong></span> command when you replace
or swap an existing component with a different component that is available
and not in use on the system.</p>
<p>You can use this command when any of the following conditions exist:</p>
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li>
<p>A disk drive has problems, and you do not have a replacement
drive. However, you do have available components elsewhere on the system. </p>
<p>You might want to use this strategy when a replacement is absolutely
necessary, but you do not want to shut down the system.</p>
</li><li>
<p>You see soft errors on the physical disks. </p>
<p>Physical
disks might report soft errors even though Solaris Volume Manager shows the mirror/submirror
or RAID-5 volume in the &#8220;Okay&#8221; state. Replacing the component
in question with another available component enables you to perform preventative
maintenance and potentially prevent hard errors from occurring.</p>
</li><li>
<p>You want to do performance tuning. </p>
<p>One way that
you can evaluate components is by using the performance monitoring feature
available from the Enhanced Storage tool within the Solaris Management Console. For example, you might see that a particular
component in a RAID-5 volume is experiencing a high load average, even though
it is in the &#8220;Okay&#8221; state. To balance the load on the volume,
you can replace that component with a component from a disk that is less utilized.
You can perform this type of replacement online without interrupting service
to the volume.</p>

<div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="replace-enable-4"></a>Maintenance and Last Erred States</h3></div></div></div>

<a class="indexterm" name="indexterm-211"></a>
<a class="indexterm" name="indexterm-212"></a>
<p>When a component in a RAID-1 or RAID-5 volume experiences errors, Solaris Volume Manager puts
the component in the &#8220;Maintenance&#8221; state. No further reads or
writes are performed to a component in the &#8220;Maintenance&#8221; state.</p>
<p>Sometimes a component goes into a &#8220;Last Erred&#8221; state. For
a RAID-1 volume, this usually occurs with a one-sided mirror. The volume experiences
errors. However, there are no redundant components to read from. For a RAID-5
volume this occurs after one component goes into &#8220;Maintenance&#8221;
state, and another component fails. The second component to fail goes into
the &#8220;Last Erred&#8221; state.</p>
<p>When either a RAID-1 volume or a RAID-5 volume has a component in the &#8220;Last
Erred&#8221; state, I/O is still attempted to the component marked &#8220;Last
Erred.&#8221; This I/O attempt occurs because a &#8220;Last Erred&#8221; component
contains the last good copy of data from Solaris Volume Manager's point of view.
With a component in the &#8220;Last Erred&#8221; state, the volume behaves
like a normal device (disk) and returns I/O errors to an application. Usually,
at this point, some data has been lost. </p>
<p>The subsequent errors on other components in the same volume are handled
differently, depending on the type of volume. </p>
<div class="variablelist"><dl><dt><span class="term">RAID-1 Volume</span></dt><dd>
<p>A RAID-1 volume might be able to tolerate many components
in the &#8220;Maintenance&#8221; state and still be read from and written
to. If components are in the &#8220;Maintenance&#8221; state, no data has
been lost. You can safely replace or enable the components in any order. If
a component is in the &#8220;Last Erred&#8221; state, you cannot replace it
until you first replace the components in the &#8220;Maintenance&#8221; state.
Replacing or enabling a component in the &#8220;Last Erred&#8221; state usually
means that some data has been lost. Be sure to validate the data on the mirror
after you repair it.</p>
</dd><dt><span class="term">RAID-5 Volume</span></dt><dd>
<p>A RAID-5 volume can tolerate a single component in the &#8220;Maintenance&#8221;
state. You can safely replace a single component in the &#8220;Maintenance&#8221;
state without losing data. If an error on another component occurs, it is
put into the &#8220;Last Erred&#8221; state. At this point, the RAID-5 volume
is a read-only device. You need to perform some type of error recovery so
that the state of the RAID-5 volume is stable and the possibility of data
loss is reduced. If a RAID-5 volume reaches a &#8220;Last Erred&#8221; state,
there is a good chance it has lost data. Be sure to validate the data on the
RAID-5 volume after you repair it.</p>
</dd></dl></div>
<p>Always replace components in the &#8220;Maintenance&#8221; state first,
followed by those in the &#8220;Last Erred&#8221; state. After a component
is replaced and resynchronized, use the <span><strong class="command">metastat</strong></span> command
to verify its state. Then, validate the data.</p>

Enabling Components in RAID-1 and RAID-5 Volumes</h3></div></div></div>

<a class="indexterm" name="indexterm-213"></a>
<a class="indexterm" name="indexterm-214"></a>
<p>
<a class="indexterm" name="indexterm-215"></a>When you replace components in a RAID-1 volume or a RAID-5 volume,
follow these guidelines: </p>
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li>
<p>Always replace components in the &#8220;Maintenance&#8221;
state first, followed by those components in the &#8220;Last Erred&#8221;
state.</p>
</li><li>
<p>After a component is replaced and resynchronized, use the <span><strong class="command">metastat</strong></span> command to verify the state of the volume. Then, validate
the data. Replacing or enabling a component in the &#8220;Last Erred&#8221;
state usually means that some data has been lost. Be sure to validate the
data on the volume after you repair it. For a UFS, run the <span><strong class="command">fsck</strong></span> command
to validate the &#8220;metadata&#8221; (the structure of the file system).
Then, check the actual user data. (Practically, users will have to examine
their files.) A database or other application must have its own way of validating
its internal data structure.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Always check for state database replicas and hot spares when
you replace components. Any state database replica in an erred state should
be deleted before you replace the physical disk. The state database replica
should be added back before you enable the component. The same procedure applies
to hot spares.</p>
</li><li>
<p>During component replacement for a RAID-5 volume, data is
recovered in one of two ways. The data is recovered either from a hot spare
currently in use or from using the RAID-5 parity, when no hot spare is in
use.</p>
</li><li>
<p>When you replace a component for a RAID-1 volume, Solaris Volume Manager automatically
starts resynchronizing the new component with the rest of the volume. When
the resynchronization completes, the replaced component becomes readable and
writable. If the failed component has been replaced with data from a hot spare,
the hot spare is placed in the &#8220;Available&#8221; state and made available
for other hot spare replacements.</p>
</li><li>
<p>The new component must be large enough to replace the old
component.</p>
</li><li>
<p>As a precaution, back up all data before you replace &#8220;Last
Erred&#8221; devices.</p>
</li></ul></div>
