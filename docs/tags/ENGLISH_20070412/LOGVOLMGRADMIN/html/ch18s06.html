<p>In previous versions of Solaris Volume Manager, all of the disks that
you planned to share between hosts in the disk set had to be connected to
each host. They also had to have the exact same path, driver, and name on
each host. Specifically, a shared disk drive had to be seen by both hosts
in the same location (<code class="literal">/dev/rdsk/c#t#d#</code>). In addition, the
shared disks had to use the same driver name (<code class="literal">ssd</code>).</p>
<p>In the current Solaris OS release,  systems that have different views
of commonly accessible storage can nonconcurrently share access to a disk
set. With the introduction of device ID support for disk sets, Solaris Volume
Manager automatically tracks disk movement within named disk sets.</p>
<div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Note</h3>

<p>Device ID support for disk sets is not supported in a Sun Cluster
environment.</p>
</div>
<p>When you upgrade to the latest Solaris OS, you need to take the disk
set once in order to enable disk tracking. For more information on taking
a disk set, see <span class="olink">How to Take a Disk Set</span>. </p>
<p>If the autotake feature is not enabled, you have to take each disk set
manually.  If this feature is enabled, this step is done automatically when
the system is rebooted. For more information on the autotake feature, see <span class="olink">Autotake Disk Sets</span>.</p>
<p>This expanded device ID support also enables you to import disk sets,
even disk sets that were created on different systems. For more information
on importing disk sets, see <span class="olink">Importing a Disk Set</span>.</p>
