<para>Each Solaris Trusted Extensions site is unique and must determine its own security policy.
Perform the following tasks when creating and managing a security policy.</para>
<listitem>
<para>Establish a security team.  The security team should have
representation from toplevel management, personnel management, computer system
management and administrators, and facilities management. The team should
review Trusted Extensions administrators' policies and procedures, and recommend
general security policies that apply to all system users.</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>Educate management and administration personnel about the
site security policy  All personnel involved in the management and administration
of the site should be educated about the security policy. Security policies
should not be made available to ordinary users because this policy information
has direct bearing on the security of the computer systems.</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<itemizedlist>
<para>Educate users about Trusted Extensions software and the policy.  All users
must be familiar with the <olink remap="external" targetdoc="819-7313">
<citetitle remap="book">Solaris Trusted Extensions User’s Guide</citetitle>
</olink>. Because the users
are usually the first to know when a system is not functioning normally, the
user should become acquainted with the system and report any problems to a
system administrator. A secure environment needs the users to notify the system
administrators immediately if they notice:</para>
<listitem>
<para>A discrepancy in the last login time that is reported at the
beginning of each session</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>An unusual change to file data</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>A lost or stolen human-readable printout</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>The inability to operate a user function</para>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>Enforce the security policy. If the security policy is not
followed and enforced, the data contained in the system that is configured
with Trusted Extensions is not secure. Procedures should be established to record
any problems and the measures that were taken to resolve the incidents.</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>Review the security policy.  The security team should perform
a periodic review of the security policy and all incidents that occurred since
the last review. Adjustments to the policy can then lead to increased security.</para>

<itemizedlist>
<para>The following list of guidelines provides some things to consider when
developing a security policy for your site.</para>
<listitem>
<para>The maximum label of a system that is configured with Trusted Extensions should
not be greater than the maximum security level of work being done at the site.</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>System reboots, power failures, and shutdowns should all be
recorded manually in a site log.</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>File-system damage should be documented and all affected files
should be analyzed for potential security-policy violations.</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>Operating manuals and administrator documentation should be
restricted to individuals with a valid need for access to that information.</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>Unusual or unexpected behavior of any Trusted Extensions software
should be reported and documented, and the cause should be determined.</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>If possible, at least two individuals should administer systems
that are configured with Trusted Extensions. One should be assigned security administrator
authorization for security-related decisions, and the other should be assigned
the system administrator authorization for computer management tasks.</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>A regular backup routine should be established.</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>Authorizations should be assigned only to users who need them
and who can be trusted to use them properly.</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>Privileges should be assigned to programs only when the program
needs the privileges to do its work, and only when the programs have been
scrutinized and proven to be trustworthy in their use of privilege. Review
the privileges on existing Trusted Extensions programs for a guide to setting
privileges on new programs.</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>Audit information should be reviewed and analyzed regularly.
Any irregular events should be noted and investigated to determine the cause
of the event.</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>The number of administration IDs should be minimized.</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>The number of setuid and setgid programs should be minimized.
Such programs should be employed only in protected subsystems.</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>An administrator should regularly verify that ordinary users
have a valid login shell.</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>An administrator should regularly verify that ordinary users
have valid user ID values and not system administration ID values.</para>

<secondary>common violations</secondary>
</indexterm>
<itemizedlist>
<para>Because no computer is 100% secure, a computer facility is only as secure
as the people who use it. The limitations of an administrator are directly
related to the actions of every individual who is involved with the use of
computer equipment and its facilities. Most actions that violate security
are easily resolved by careful users or additional equipment. However, the
following list gives examples of problems that can occur:</para>
<listitem>
<para>Users give passwords to other individuals who should not have
access to the computer system.</para>
</listitem>

<para>Users write down passwords and lose or leave the passwords
in nonsecure locations.</para>
