<a name="chp-structs"></a>Chapter&nbsp;7<h3>Structs and Unions</h3><p>Collections of related variables can be grouped together into composite data objects called structs and unions. You can define these objects in D by creating new type definitions for them. You can use your new types for any D variables, including associative array values. This chapter explores the syntax and semantics for creating and manipulating these composite types and the D operators that interact with them. The syntax for structs and unions is illustrated using several example programs that demonstrate the use of the DTrace <tt>fbt</tt> and <tt>pid</tt> providers.</p>
<a name="chp-structs-1"></a><h3>Structs</h3>
<p><a name="indexterm-119"></a>The D keyword <tt>struct</tt>, short for structure, is used to introduce a new type composed of a group of other types. The new struct type can be used as the type for D variables and arrays, enabling you to define groups of related variables under a single name. D structs are the same as the corresponding construct in C and C++. If you have programmed in the Java programming language, think of a D struct as a class, but one with data members only and no methods.</p>
<p>Let's suppose you want to create a more sophisticated system call tracing program in D that records a number of things about each <tt>read</tt>(2) and <tt>write</tt>(2) system call executed by your shell, such as the elapsed time, number of calls, and the largest byte count passed as an argument. You could write a D clause to record these properties in three separate associative arrays as shown in the following example:</p>
<pre>syscall::read:entry, syscall::write:entry
/pid == 12345/
{
	ts[probefunc] = timestamp;
	calls[probefunc]++;
	maxbytes[probefunc] = arg2 > maxbytes[probefunc] ?
	    arg2 : maxbytes[probefunc];
}</pre><p>However, this clause is inefficient because DTrace must create three separate associative arrays and store separate copies of the identical tuple values corresponding to <tt>probefunc</tt> for each one. Instead, you can conserve space and make your program easier to read and maintain by using a struct. First, declare a new struct type at the top of the program source file:</p>
<pre>struct callinfo {
	uint64_t ts;      /* timestamp of last syscall entry */
	uint64_t elapsed; /* total elapsed time in nanoseconds */
	uint64_t calls;   /* number of calls made */
	size_t maxbytes;  /* maximum byte count argument */
};</pre><p>The <tt>struct</tt> keyword is followed by an optional identifier used to refer back to our new type, which is now known as <tt>struct callinfo</tt>. The struct members are then enclosed in a set of braces <tt>{ }</tt> and the entire declaration is terminated by a semicolon (<tt>;</tt>). Each struct member is defined using the same syntax as a D variable declaration, with the type of the member listed first followed by an identifier naming the member and another semicolon (<tt>;</tt>).</p>
<p>The struct declaration itself simply defines the new type; it does not create any variables or allocate any storage in DTrace. Once declared, you can use <tt>struct callinfo</tt> as a type throughout the remainder of your D program, and each variable of type <tt>struct callinfo</tt> will store a copy of the four variables described by our structure template. The members will be arranged in memory in order according to the member list, with padding space introduced between members as required for data object alignment purposes.</p>
<p>You can use the member identifier names to access the individual member values using the &ldquo;<tt>.</tt>&rdquo; operator by writing an expression of the form:</p>
<p><i>variable-name</i><tt>.</tt><i>member-name</i></p>
<p>The following example is an improved program using the new structure type. Go to your editor and type in the following D program and save it in a file named <tt>rwinfo.d</tt>:</p>
<a name="ex-rwinfo.d"></a>Example 7-1 <tt>rwinfo.d</tt>: Gather <tt>read</tt>(2) and <tt>write</tt>(2) Statistics<pre>struct callinfo {
	uint64_t ts;      /* timestamp of last syscall entry */
	uint64_t elapsed; /* total elapsed time in nanoseconds */
	uint64_t calls;   /* number of calls made */
	size_t maxbytes;  /* maximum byte count argument */
};

struct callinfo i[string];	/* declare i as an associative array */

syscall::read:entry, syscall::write:entry
/pid == $1/
{
	i[probefunc].ts = timestamp;
	i[probefunc].calls++;
	i[probefunc].maxbytes = arg2 > i[probefunc].maxbytes ?
		arg2 : i[probefunc].maxbytes;
}

syscall::read:return, syscall::write:return
/i[probefunc].ts != 0 &amp;&amp; pid == $1/
{
	i[probefunc].elapsed += timestamp - i[probefunc].ts;
}

END
{
	printf("        calls  max bytes  elapsed nsecs\n");
	printf("------  -----  ---------  -------------\n");
	printf("  read  %5d  %9d  %d\n",
	    i["read"].calls, i["read"].maxbytes, i["read"].elapsed);
	printf(" write  %5d  %9d  %d\n",
	    i["write"].calls, i["write"].maxbytes, i["write"].elapsed);
}</pre><p>After you type in the program, run <tt>dtrace -q -s rwinfo.d</tt>, specifying one of your shell processes. Then go type in a few commands in your shell and, when you're done entering your shell commands, type Control-C in the <tt>dtrace</tt> terminal to fire the <tt>END</tt> probe and print the results:</p>
<pre><tt><b># dtrace -q -s rwinfo.d `pgrep -n ksh`</b></tt>
<tt><b>^C</b></tt>
        calls  max bytes  elapsed nsecs
------  -----  ---------  -------------

#</pre><a name="chp-structs-2"></a><h3>Pointers to Structs</h3>
<p><a name="indexterm-120"></a><a name="indexterm-121"></a>Referring to structs using pointers is very common in C and D. You can use the operator <tt>-></tt> to access struct members through a pointer. If a <tt>struct s</tt> has a member <tt>m</tt> and you have a pointer to this struct named <tt>sp</tt> (that is, <tt>sp</tt> is a variable of type <tt>struct s *</tt>), you can either use the <tt>*</tt> operator to first dereference <tt>sp</tt> pointer in order to access the member:</p>
<pre>struct s *sp;

(*sp).m</pre><p>or you can use the <tt>-></tt> operator as a shorthand for this notation. The following two D fragments are equivalent in meaning if <tt>sp</tt> is a pointer to a struct:</p>
<pre>(*sp).m				sp->m</pre><p><a name="indexterm-122"></a>DTrace provides several built-in variables which are pointers to structs, including <tt>curpsinfo</tt> and <tt>curlwpsinfo</tt>. These pointers refer to the structs <tt>psinfo</tt> and <tt>lwpsinfo</tt> respectively, and their content provides a snapshot of information about the state of the current process and lightweight process (LWP) associated with the thread that has fired the current probe. A Solaris LWP is the kernel's representation of a user thread, upon which the Solaris threads and POSIX threads interfaces are built. For convenience, DTrace exports this information in the same form as the <tt>/proc</tt> filesystem files <tt>/proc/</tt><i>pid</i><tt>/psinfo</tt> and <tt>/proc/</tt><i>pid</i><tt>/lwps/</tt><i>lwpid</i><tt>/lwpsinfo</tt>. The <tt>/proc</tt> structures are used by observability and debugging tools such as <tt>ps</tt>(1), <tt>pgrep</tt>(1), and <tt>truss</tt>(1), and are defined in the system header file <tt>&lt;sys/procfs.h></tt> and are described in the <tt>proc</tt>(4) man page. Here are few example expressions using <tt>curpsinfo</tt>, their types, and their meanings:</p>
<table><tr><td><p><tt>curpsinfo->pr_pid</tt></p>
</td><td><p><tt>pid_t</tt></p>
</td><td><p>current process ID</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><p><tt>curpsinfo->pr_fname</tt></p>
</td><td><p><tt>char []</tt></p>
</td><td><p>executable file name</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td><p><tt>curpsinfo->pr_psargs</tt></p>
</td><td><p><tt>char []</tt></p>
</td><td><p>initial command line arguments</p>
</td></tr>
</table><p><a name="indexterm-123"></a>You should review the complete structure definition later by examining the <tt>&lt;sys/procfs.h></tt> header file and the corresponding descriptions in <tt>proc</tt>(4). The next example uses the <tt>pr_psargs</tt> member to identify a process of interest by matching command-line arguments.</p>
<p>Structs are used frequently to create complex data structures in C programs, so the ability to describe and reference structs from D also provides a powerful capability for observing the inner workings of the Solaris operating system kernel and its system interfaces. In addition to using the aforementioned <tt>curpsinfo</tt> struct, the next example examines some kernel structs as well by observing the relationship between the <tt>ksyms</tt>(7D) driver and <tt>read</tt>(2) requests. The driver makes use of two common structs, known as <tt>uio</tt>(9S) and <tt>iovec</tt>(9S), to respond to requests to read from the character device file <tt>/dev/ksyms</tt>.</p>
<p>The <tt>uio</tt> struct, accessed using the name <tt>struct uio</tt> or type alias <tt>uio_t</tt>, is described in the <tt>uio</tt>(9S) man page and is used to describe an I/O request that involves copying data between the kernel and a user process. The <tt>uio</tt> in turn contains an array of one or more <tt>iovec</tt>(9S) structures which each describe a piece of the requested I/O, in the event that multiple chunks are requested using the <tt>readv</tt>(2) or <tt>writev</tt>(2) system calls. One of the kernel device driver interface (DDI) routines that operates on <tt>struct uio</tt> is the function <tt>uiomove</tt>(9F), which is one of a family of functions kernel drivers use to respond to user process <tt>read</tt>(2) requests and copy data back to user processes.</p>
<p>The <tt>ksyms</tt> driver manages a character device file named <tt>/dev/ksyms</tt>, which appears to be an ELF file containing information about the kernel's symbol table, but is in fact an illusion created by the driver using the set of modules that are currently loaded into the kernel. The driver uses the <tt>uiomove</tt>(9F) routine to respond to <tt>read</tt>(2) requests. The next example illustrates that the arguments and calls to <tt>read</tt>(2) from <tt>/dev/ksyms</tt> match the calls by the driver to <tt>uiomove</tt>(9F) to copy the results back into the user address space at the location specified to <tt>read</tt>(2).</p>
<p>We can use the <tt>strings</tt>(1) utility with the <tt>-a</tt> option to force a bunch of reads from <tt>/dev/ksyms</tt>. Try running <tt>strings -a /dev/ksyms</tt> in your shell and see what output it produces. In an editor, type in the first clause of the example script and save it in a file named <tt>ksyms.d</tt>:</p>
<pre>syscall::read:entry
/curpsinfo->pr_psargs == "strings -a /dev/ksyms"/
{
	printf("read %u bytes to user address %x\n", arg2, arg1);
}</pre><p>This first clause uses the expression <tt>curpsinfo->pr_psargs</tt> to access and match the command-line arguments of our <tt>strings</tt>(1) command so that the script selects the correct <tt>read</tt>(2) requests before tracing the arguments. Notice that by using operator <tt>==</tt> with a left-hand argument that is an array of <tt>char</tt> and a right-hand argument that is a string, the D compiler infers that the left-hand argument should be promoted to a string and a string comparison should be performed. Type in and execute the command <tt>dtrace -q -s ksyms.d</tt> in one shell, and then type in the command <tt>strings -a /dev/ksyms</tt> in another shell. As <tt>strings</tt>(1) executes, you will see output from DTrace similar to the following example:</p>
<pre><tt><b># dtrace -q -s ksyms.d</b></tt>
read 8192 bytes to user address 80639fc
read 8192 bytes to user address 80639fc
read 8192 bytes to user address 80639fc
read 8192 bytes to user address 80639fc
...
<tt><b>^C</b></tt>
#</pre><p>This example can be extended using a common D programming technique to follow a thread from this initial <tt>read</tt>(2) request deeper into the kernel. Upon entry to the kernel in <tt>syscall::read:entry</tt>, the next script sets a thread-local flag variable indicating this thread is of interest, and clears this flag on <tt>syscall::read:return</tt>. Once the flag is set, it can be used as a predicate on other probes to instrument kernel functions such as <tt>uiomove</tt>(9F). The DTrace function boundary tracing (<tt>fbt</tt>) provider publishes probes for entry and return to functions defined within the kernel, including those in the DDI. Type in the following source code which uses the <tt>fbt</tt> provider to instrument <tt>uiomove</tt>(9F) and again save it in the file <tt>ksyms.d</tt>:</p>
<a name="ex-ksyms.d"></a>Example 7-2 <tt>ksyms.d</tt>: Trace <tt>read</tt>(2) and <tt>uiomove</tt>(9F) Relationship<pre>/*
 * When our strings(1) invocation starts a read(2), set a watched flag on
 * the current thread.  When the read(2) finishes, clear the watched flag.
 */
syscall::read:entry
/curpsinfo->pr_psargs == "strings -a /dev/ksyms"/
{
	printf("read %u bytes to user address %x\n", arg2, arg1);
	self->watched = 1;
}

syscall::read:return
/self->watched/
{
	self->watched = 0;
}

/*
 * Instrument uiomove(9F).  The prototype for this function is as follows:
 * int uiomove(caddr_t addr, size_t nbytes, enum uio_rw rwflag, uio_t *uio);
 */
fbt::uiomove:entry
/self->watched/
{
	this->iov = args[3]->uio_iov;

	printf("uiomove %u bytes to %p in pid %d\n",
	    this->iov->iov_len, this->iov->iov_base, pid);
}</pre><p>The final clause of the example uses the thread-local variable <tt>self->watched</tt> to identify when a kernel thread of interest enters the DDI routine <tt>uiomove</tt>(9F). Once there, the script uses the built-in <tt>args</tt> array to access the fourth argument (<tt>args[3]</tt>) to <tt>uiomove()</tt>, which is a pointer to the <tt>struct uio</tt> representing the request. The D compiler automatically associates each member of the <tt>args</tt> array with the type corresponding to the C function prototype for the instrumented kernel routine. The <tt>uio_iov</tt> member contains a pointer to the <tt>struct iovec</tt> for the request. A copy of this pointer is saved for use in our clause in the clause-local variable <tt>this->iov</tt>. In the final statement, the script dereferences <tt>this->iov</tt> to access the <tt>iovec</tt> members <tt>iov_len</tt> and <tt>iov_base</tt>, which represent the length in bytes and destination base address for <tt>uiomove</tt>(9F), respectively. These values should match the input parameters to the <tt>read</tt>(2) system call issued on the driver. Go to your shell and run <tt>dtrace -q -s ksyms.d</tt> and then again enter the command <tt>strings -a /dev/ksyms</tt> in another shell. You should see output similar to the following example:</p>
<pre><tt><b># dtrace -q -s ksyms.d</b></tt>
read 8192 bytes at user address 80639fc
uiomove 8192 bytes to 80639fc in pid 101038
read 8192 bytes at user address 80639fc
uiomove 8192 bytes to 80639fc in pid 101038
read 8192 bytes at user address 80639fc
uiomove 8192 bytes to 80639fc in pid 101038
read 8192 bytes at user address 80639fc
uiomove 8192 bytes to 80639fc in pid 101038
...
<tt><b>^C</b></tt>
#</pre><p>The addresses and process IDs will be different in your output, but you should observe that the input arguments to <tt>read</tt>(2) match the parameters passed to <tt>uiomove</tt>(9F) by the <tt>ksyms</tt> driver.</p>
<a name="chp-structs-3"></a><h3>Unions</h3>
<p><a name="indexterm-124"></a>Unions are another kind of composite type supported by ANSI-C and D, and are closely related to structs. A union is a composite type where a set of members of different types are defined and the member objects all occupy the same region of storage. A union is therefore an object of variant type, where only one member is valid at any given time, depending on how the union has been assigned. Typically, some other variable or piece of state is used to indicate which union member is currently valid. The size of a union is the size of its largest member, and the memory alignment used for the union is the maximum alignment required by the union members.</p>
<p><a name="indexterm-125"></a><a name="indexterm-126"></a>The Solaris <tt>kstat</tt> framework defines a struct containing a union that is used in the following example to illustrate and observe C and D unions. The <tt>kstat</tt> framework is used to export a set of named counters representing kernel statistics such as memory usage and I/O throughput. The framework is used to implement utilities such as <tt>mpstat</tt>(1M) and <tt>iostat</tt>(1M). This framework uses <tt>struct kstat_named</tt> to represent a named counter and its value and is defined as follows:</p>
<pre>struct kstat_named {
	char name[KSTAT_STRLEN]; /* name of counter */
	uchar_t data_type;	/* data type */
	union {
		char c[16];
		int32_t i32;
		uint32_t ui32;
		long l;
		ulong_t ul;
		...
	} value;	/* value of counter */
};	</pre><p>The examine declaration is shortened the declaration for illustrative purposes. The complete structure definition can be found in the <tt>&lt;sys/kstat.h></tt> header file and is described in <tt>kstat_named</tt>(9S). The declaration above is valid in both ANSI-C and D, and defines a struct containing as one of its members a union value with members of various types, depending on the type of the counter. Notice that since the union itself is declared inside of another type, <tt>struct kstat_named</tt>, a formal name for the union type is omitted. This declaration style is known as an anonymous union. The member named <tt>value</tt> is of a union type described by the preceding declaration, but this union type itself has no name because it does not need to be used anywhere else. The struct member <tt>data_type</tt> is assigned a value that indicates which union member is valid for each object of type <tt>struct kstat_named</tt>. A set of C preprocessor tokens are defined for the values of <tt>data_type</tt>. For example, the token <tt>KSTAT_DATA_CHAR</tt> is equal to zero and indicates that the member <tt>value.c</tt> is where the value is currently stored.</p>
<p><a name="indexterm-127"></a><a name="indexterm-128"></a><a href="p16.html#ex-kstat.d">Example 7-3</a> demonstrates accessing the <tt>kstat_named.value</tt> union by tracing a user process. The <tt>kstat</tt> counters can be sampled from a user process using the <tt>kstat_data_lookup</tt>(3KSTAT) function, which returns a pointer to a <tt>struct kstat_named</tt>. The <tt>mpstat</tt>(1M) utility calls this function repeatedly as it executes in order to sample the latest counter values. Go to your shell and try running <tt>mpstat 1</tt> and observe the output. Press Control-C in your shell to abort <tt>mpstat</tt> after a few seconds. To observe counter sampling, we would like to enable a probe that fires each time the <tt>mpstat</tt> command calls the <tt>kstat_data_lookup</tt>(3KSTAT) function in <tt>libkstat</tt>. To do so, we're going to make use of a new DTrace provider: <tt>pid</tt>. The <tt>pid</tt> provider permits you to dynamically create probes in user processes at C symbol locations such as function entry points. You can ask the <tt>pid</tt> provider to create a probe at a user function entry and return sites by writing probe descriptions of the form:</p>
<tt>pid</tt><i>process-ID</i><tt>:</tt><i>object-name</i><tt>:</tt><i>function-name</i><tt>:entry</tt>
<tt>pid</tt><i>process-ID</i><tt>:</tt><i>object-name</i><tt>:</tt><i>function-name</i><tt>:return</tt><p>For example, if you wanted to create a probe in process ID 12345 that fires on entry to <tt>kstat_data_lookup</tt>(3KSTAT), you would write the following probe description:</p>
<pre>pid12345:libkstat:kstat_data_lookup:entry</pre><p>The <tt>pid</tt> provider inserts dynamic instrumentation into the specified user process at the program location corresponding to the probe description. The probe implementation forces each user thread that reaches the instrumented program location to trap into the operating system kernel and enter DTrace, firing the corresponding probe. So although the instrumentation location is associated with a user process, the DTrace predicates and actions you specify still execute in the context of the operating system kernel. The <tt>pid</tt> provider is described in further detail in <a href="p54.html">Chapter&nbsp;30, <tt>pid</tt> Provider</a>.</p>
<p><a name="indexterm-129"></a><a name="indexterm-130"></a><a name="indexterm-131"></a>Instead of having to edit your D program source each time you wish to apply your program to a different process, you can insert identifiers called macro variables into your program that are evaluated at the time your program is compiled and replaced with the additional <tt>dtrace</tt> command-line arguments. Macro variables are specified using a dollar sign <tt>$</tt> followed by an identifier or digit. If you execute the command <tt>dtrace -s <i>script</i> foo bar baz</tt>, the D compiler will automatically define the macro variables <tt>$1</tt>, <tt>$2</tt>, and <tt>$3</tt> to be the tokens <tt>foo</tt>, <tt>bar</tt>, and <tt>baz</tt> respectively. You can use macro variables in D program expressions or in probe descriptions. For example, the following probe descriptions instrument whatever process ID is specified as an additional argument to <tt>dtrace</tt>:</p>
<pre>pid$1:libkstat:kstat_data_lookup:entry
{
	self->ksname = arg1;
}

pid$1:libkstat:kstat_data_lookup:return
/self->ksname != NULL &amp;&amp; arg1 != NULL/

Once <tt>mpstat</tt> is running, execute the command <tt>dtrace -q -s kstat.d `pgrep mpstat`</tt> in your other shell. You will see output corresponding to the statistics that are being accessed.

<tt><b>#</b></tt></pre><p>If you capture the output in each terminal window and subtract each value from the value reported by the previous iteration through the statistics, you should be able to correlate the <tt>dtrace</tt> output with the <tt>mpstat</tt> output. The example program records the counter name pointer on entry to the lookup function, and then performs most of the tracing work on return from <tt>kstat_data_lookup</tt>(3KSTAT). The D built-in functions <tt>copyinstr()</tt> and <tt>copyin()</tt> copy the function results from the user process back into DTrace when <tt>arg1</tt> (the return value) is not <tt>NULL</tt>. Once the <tt>kstat</tt> data has been copied, the example reports the <tt>ui64</tt> counter value from the union. This simplified example assumes that <tt>mpstat</tt> samples counters that use the <tt>value.ui64</tt> member. As an exercise, try recoding <tt>kstat.d</tt> to use multiple predicates and print out the union member corresponding to the <tt>data_type</tt> member. You can also try to create a version of <tt>kstat.d</tt> that computes the difference between successive data values and actually produces output similar to <tt>mpstat</tt>.</p>
