This section bypasses most of the important material you'll find later
in this document and makes a lot of assumptions about your development
and build environment.  The intent is to offer a set of step-by-step
instructions that will help you begin development in less than an hour,
even if you have no previous Solaris development experience.  Although
this procedure will work for most people, it cannot work for all.  There
are dozens of tools and utilities used in developing OpenSolaris, and
most have at least a few options and arguments.  This tremendous
flexibility exists for a reason: each developer has unique needs.  If
you encounter difficulty in following these instructions, don't give up!
Each instruction lists the relevant sections you can read to learn more
about the commands and procedures used in that step.  If all else fails,
please see <a href="ch01s02.html">1.2 Getting Help</a> to learn about the many resources
available to the OpenSolaris developer community.
</p><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="_1_3_1_Example_Environment"></a>1.3.1 Example Environment</h3></div></div></div><p>
The instructions in the remainder of section 1.3 cover building and
installing on both x86 (32-bit only or 64-bit capable; there are no
differences) and SPARC environments.  They have been tested and verified
to work.  Because it is impossible to test on every imaginable hardware,
software, and policy configuration, our testing was limited to the
environments described here.  While we expect these instructions will be
broadly applicable, the more similar your environment is, the more
likely you will be able to use them without modification.
</p><div class="sect3" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="_1_3_1_1_x86_Environment"></a>1.3.1.1 x86 Environment</h4></div></div></div><p>
We assume that the entire system is dedicated to an OpenSolaris-based
distribution, such as Solaris Express.  Our test machine is a dual Intel
Pentium 4 Xeon 2.8 GHz with hyperthreading enabled, 512MB memory, a
standard ATA controller, and a Broadcom 57xx ethernet adapter.  The
machine has 2 40GB ATA disks, partitioned as follows:
</p><p>
Both c0d0p0 and c1d0p0 have a fdisk single partition which assigns the
entire disk to Solaris.
</p><pre class="programlisting">
c0d0s0 contains a 35GB UFS filesystem mounted on /.
c0d0s1 contains a 2GB swap space.
c0d0s8 is a 1MB boot slice.
</pre><pre class="programlisting">
c1d0s0 contains a 37GB UFS filesystem mounted on /aux0.
</pre><p>
Your system does not need to be identical or even similar to this one in
order for it to work; this configuration is merely an example of a
supported system.  Please see <a href="ch02.html">Prerequisites</a> for more information
about the requirements for installing, developing, and building parts of
OpenSolaris.  Some consolidations may have additional requirements, so
be sure to consult the latest release notes.
</p></div><div class="sect3" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="_1_3_1_2_SPARC_Environment"></a>1.3.1.2 SPARC Environment</h4></div></div></div><p>
Our SPARC test environment is a Sun Fire V210 server with 2 1.0 GHz
UltraSPARC-IIIi CPUs and 2 GB memory.  The machine has two 36GB SCSI
disks, partitioned as follows:
</p><pre class="programlisting">
c1t0d0s0 contains a 8GB UFS filesystem mounted on /.
c1t0d0s1 contains a 4GB swap space.
c1t0d0s3 contains a 22GB UFS filesystem mounted on /export1.
</pre><pre class="programlisting">
c1t1d0s0 contains a 35GB UFS filesystem mounted on /export2.
</pre><p>
Your system does not need to be identical or even similar to this one in
order for it to work; this configuration is merely an example of a
supported system.  Please see <a href="ch02.html">Prerequisites</a> for more information
about the requirements for installing, developing, and building
OpenSolaris.
</p></div></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="_1_3_2_Installing_a_Binary_Dist"></a>1.3.2 Installing a Binary Distribution</h3></div></div></div><p>
Before building your own source or installing the provided binary
archives, you will have to install a complete OpenSolaris-based
distribution.  This is because you most likely will need drivers,
packaging tools, and other components that aren't in the Operating
System and Networking components released with OpenSolaris.  As of this
writing, the only distribution on which OpenSolaris binaries can be
built or installed is Solaris Express, build 22 or newer.
</p><p>
If you are an ON developer and want to run the very latest bits or have
made changes to the kernel or core libraries, you will also need to
update your system to a set of binaries newer than the latest available
build of your distribution.  The process for doing this is called
<a href="apa.html#_BFU">BFU</a> and is described in detail below.  The BFU process uses CPIO
<a href="apa.html#_archives">archives</a> containing the binaries built from ON; you can download
these archives at <a href="http://opensolaris.org/os/downloads/on/" target="_top">http://opensolaris.org/os/downloads/on/</a> or you
can build them yourself (if you have made large changes to the system,
you will be install those you built yourself).  If your interest in
making changes is limited to simple user-level applications, you can
usually get by by building those applications individually and copying
them over the system's existing binaries rather than BFUing.
</p><p>
Both parts of this process - the initial system install (sometimes
referred to as <a href="apa.html#_suninstall">suninstall</a> to distinguish it from <a href="apa.html#_BFU">BFU</a> and
especially ???) and BFUing are documented here; all users and
developers will need to perform the steps described in <a href="ch01s03.html#_1_3_2_1_Installing_an_OpenSola">1.3.2.1 Installing an OpenSolaris-based Distribution (Solaris Express)</a>, while
only developers interested in using the very latest ON bits or making
significant modifications to core system components will need to read
???.
</p><p>
As new distributions are created which can be used as a base for
building and installing OpenSolaris bits, each will have its own section
below similar to 1.3.2.1.  If your favorite distribution isn't mentioned
here, please contribute a section explaining how to install it.
</p><div class="sect3" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="_1_3_2_1_Installing_an_OpenSola"></a>1.3.2.1 Installing an OpenSolaris-based Distribution (Solaris Express)</h4></div></div></div><p>
The Solaris installation procedure is well documented at
<a href="http://docs.sun.com/app/docs/coll/1236.1" target="_top">http://docs.sun.com/app/docs/coll/1236.1</a>.  While most of the
default options presented in the interactive installation procedure are
acceptable for creating a development or build system, you should take
note of the following:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Locales are not needed.</p><p>
You do not need to install any locales unless you need them for other
reasons.  Selecting the C (POSIX) locale as default is recommended.
</p></li><li><p>Follow local policies,</p><p>
Network configuration, time zone, use of IPv6 and Kerberos, name
service, and other environment-specific parameters must be set according
to local policy.  OpenSolaris development is not directly affected by
them.
</p></li><li><p>Reserve space for sources (and optionally builds).</p><p>
To install the sources, you will need at least 300MB of free space (more
is recommended).  If you also wish to build OpenON, you will need
several GB.  It is recommended that you create a separate local
filesystem to store these sources and objects as well as user home
directories and other standalone data if appropriate to your
configuration; our example system mounts this filesystem at /aux0.  See
<a href="ch02.html#_2_1_Hardware">2.1 Hardware</a> for more detailed information.
</p></li><li><p>Install the Entire Distribution package cluster.</p><p>
If you do not have enough disk space to install the Entire Distribution,
you will need to upgrade to a disk at least 9GB in size.  You may also
be able to install the Developer package metacluster instead, but this
has not been tested and may not be sufficient to build successfully.
See <a href="ch02s02.html">2.2 Operating Environment Packages</a> for more information on
software requirements.
</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="sect3" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="_1_3_2_2_Installing_Required_To"></a>1.3.2.2 Installing Required Tools</h4></div></div></div><p>
There are two sets of tools required to build OpenON: compilers and
ON-specific build tools.  See <a href="ch02s03.html">2.3 Obtaining and Installing Compilers</a>
and <a href="ch02s04.html">2.4 Obtaining and Installing Custom Tools</a> for detailed
information.  Here we assume you want to use the Studio 10 compiler (you
cannot yet use Studio 11 to build OpenON).  Note that many of the ON
build tools are also used by other consolidations, including SFW and
Network Storage (NWS).
</p><p>
Download the installed image (not the full product) into a scratch area,
such as <code class="code">/var/tmp</code>.  The file is normally called
<code class="code">sunstudio10-DATE.PLATFORM.tar.bz2</code>.  Before you start, be sure you
have at least 900MB free in <code class="code">/opt</code>.  You can do this by examining the
output of:
</p><pre class="programlisting">
$ df -klh /opt
Filesystem             size   used  avail capacity  Mounted on
/dev/dsk/c1t0d0s0      7.9G   3.8G   4.0G    50%    /
</pre><p>
If the 'avail' field is 900M or larger, you have enough space to
continue.
</p><pre class="programlisting">
$ su
Password:
# cd /opt
# bzip2 -dc /var/tmp/sunstudio10-20050614.sparc.tar.bz2 | tar xf -
</pre><p>
Note that your filename may differ slightly depending on your platform
and future compiler releases.
</p><p>
Next, download the ON-specific build tools.  This file is normally
called <code class="code">SUNWonbld-DATE.PLATFORM.tar.bz2</code> and contains a SVR4 package.
Assuming you downloaded it to <code class="code">/var/tmp</code>, you'll now want to do:
</p><pre class="programlisting">
$ cd /var/tmp
$ bzip2 -dc SUNWonbld-DATE.PLATFORM.tar.bz2 | tar xf -
$ su
Password:
# pkgadd -d onbld SUNWonbld
</pre><p>
Note that if you have installed a previous version of the tools, you
will need to use pkgrm(1m) to remove them first.
</p><p>
Once you have installed your distribution, the compilers, and
ON-specific build tools, you're ready to build from source or install
from binaries.  If you're building from source, continue on to the next
section.  Otherwise, skip ahead to <a href="ch01s03.html#_1_3_4_Upgrading_to_the_Latest_">1.3.4 Upgrading to the Latest ON Bits</a>.
</p></div></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="_1_3_3_Building_ON_from_Source"></a>1.3.3 Building ON from Source</h3></div></div></div><div class="sect3" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="_1_3_3_1_Creating_a_Source_Work"></a>1.3.3.1 Creating a Source Workspace</h4></div></div></div><p>
Suppose you are using <code class="code">/aux0/testws</code> as your <a href="apa.html#_workspace">workspace</a>.
</p><p>
First, cd to <code class="code">/aux0/testws</code> and unpack the sources and closed binaries,
e.g.,
</p><pre class="programlisting">
$ mkdir /aux0/testws
$ cd /aux0/testws
$ bzip2 -dc opensolaris-src-DATE.tar.bz2 | tar xf -
$ bzip2 -dc opensolaris-closed-bins-DATE.PLATFORM.tar.gz | tar xf -
</pre><p>
The sources will unpack into <code class="code">usr/src</code> and the binaries will unpack
into <code class="code">closed/root_PLATFORM</code> (i.e., <code class="code">closed/root_i386</code> or
<code class="code">closed/root_sparc</code>).
</p></div></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="_1_3_3_2_Performing_a_Basic_Bui"></a>1.3.3.2 Performing a Basic Build</h3></div></div></div><p>
First, Create an environment file to guide tools like nightly(1) and
bldenv(1).
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Copy in the template environment file</p><p>
Copy <code class="code">/aux0/testws/usr/src/tools/env/opensolaris.sh</code> to /aux0/testws.
It doesn't have to go in /aux0/testws, but that's a convenient place to
put it.  Nor do you have to keep the name opensolaris.sh, but that's the
name we'll use in these notes.
</p><pre class="programlisting">
$ cp /aux0/testws/usr/src/tools/env/opensolaris.sh /aux0/testws
</pre></li><li><p>Make required changes</p><p>
First, add <code class="code">/opt/onbld/bin</code> to your PATH environment variable.  You may
wish to make this change permanent by editing your <code class="code">.login</code> or
<code class="code">.profile</code> files (as appropriate for your shell).
</p><p>
Then, using your favorite text editor, make the following changes to
<code class="code">opensolaris.sh</code>:
</p><p>
Change GATE to the name of the top-level directory (e.g., <code class="code">testws</code>).
</p><p>
Change CODEMGR_WS to the top-level path (e.g., <code class="code">/aux0/testws</code>).
</p><p>
Change STAFFER to your login.
</p></li><li><p>(optional) Customize VERSION.</p><p>
VERSION is the string that "uname -v" will print.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
Then, To build a complete set of BFU archives, cd to <code class="code">/aux0/testws</code>,
utter
</p><pre class="programlisting">
$ nightly ./opensolaris.sh &amp;
</pre><p>
and find something else to work on for a few hours.  You can monitor the
build's progress using ptree(1).  nightly(1) will send mail to $MAILTO
when it has finished.  The mail will have an overview of the build
results. A copy of the mail text and a more detailed log file will be
available in the <a href="apa.html#_workspace">workspace</a> (e.g.,
<code class="code">/aux0/testws/log/log.MMDD/nightly.log</code>, where MMDD is the build date).
The log file is also available (in a slightly different location) during
the build; to monitor the progress of your build in real time, you can
do:
</p><pre class="programlisting">
$ tail -f /aux0/testws/log/nightly.log
</pre><p>
The location of the log is controlled by the LOGFILE and ATLOG
variables; see nightly(1) for more details.
</p><p>
If your build fails, you can correct the problem, then use the '-i'
option to nightly to run an incremental build, bypassing the initial
clobber.  See the nightly(1) manual and <a href="ch04.html">Building OpenSolaris</a> for
more information.
</p><p>
To build a specific component, first use bldenv(1) to set up various
environment variables, then cd to the subtree that you want to build.
For example:
</p><pre class="programlisting">
$ cd /aux0/testws
$ bldenv ./opensolaris.sh
[status information from bldenv]
$ cd usr/src/cmd/vi
$ dmake all
</pre><p>
To build the kernel, run dmake(1) from <code class="code">usr/src/uts</code>.
</p><p>
See <a href="ch04.html">Building OpenSolaris</a> for more information on the build process
and tools.  Once you have successfully completed a build, see <a href="ch05.html">Installing and Testing ON</a> for more information on what to do with it.
</p></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="_1_3_4_Upgrading_to_the_Latest_"></a>1.3.4 Upgrading to the Latest ON Bits</h3></div></div></div><p>
<span class="bold"><strong>WARNING!</strong></span>  The steps described in this section are optional for
advanced developers only and are not required to view and edit the
sources.  Performing this process unnecessarily will result in reduced
system manageability and exposes you to the greater risks associated
with the use of development software.  <span class="bold"><strong>If in doubt, SKIP THIS STEP.</strong></span>
See <a href="ch05s03.html">5.3 Using BFU to Install ON</a> for more details on the risks and
benefits of this process.
</p><p>
If you wish to build one or more OpenSolaris consolidations, you may in
some cases be required to update all or part of your system's software
before doing so.  Such requirements are listed for each build in the
relevant consolidation's release notes; in most cases your existing
installation will be sufficient to build and use the latest sources.  In
general, it is both safer and more effective to use the official
suninstall, upgrade, or LiveUpgrade process to install a more recent
Solaris Express build than to use the BFU process; the official upgrade
upgrades all of your system software, while BFU upgrades only a few
parts.  Unless you need to use the very latest ON bits, you should skip
this step.
</p><p>
Before proceeding, please read <a href="ch05s03.html">5.3 Using BFU to Install ON</a> in its
entirety.  The remainder of this section provides an example usage of
bfu(1), but you must understand how BFU works, what BFU conflicts are,
and how to resolve them before you can successfully use BFU.  It's
impossible to overemphasize this: <span class="bold"><strong>You almost certainly want to let
acr(1) resolve conflicts for you</strong></span>.  Resolving conflicts by hand can be
difficult, time-consuming, and error-prone.  Errors in conflict
resolution will often leave your machine in a nonworking state.  We
assume here that you will be resolving conflicts automatically.
</p><p>
First, download the BFU archives for your system architecture from
<a href="http://opensolaris.org/os/downloads/on/" target="_top">http://opensolaris.org/os/downloads/on/</a>.  Then, unpack the archives
into a temporary directory of your choice.  In this example, we will use
<code class="code">/var/tmp/bfu</code> to store the archives and LATEST to be the build you
want to install.
</p><pre class="programlisting">
# mkdir /var/tmp/bfu
# cd /var/tmp/bfu
# bzip2 -dc /path/to/opensolaris-bfu-LATEST.sparc.tar.bz2 | tar xf -
</pre><p>
This will create the directory and
<code class="code">/var/tmp/bfu/archives-LATEST/sparc</code>.  In it will be a set of CPIO
archives; these are used by bfu(1) to overwrite your system binaries.
Next, exit the window system, log in on the console as root, and issue
the command:
</p><pre class="programlisting">
# /opt/onbld/bin/bfu /var/tmp/bfu/archives-LATEST/sparc
</pre><p>
You may see warnings about upgrading non-ON packages; if you have not
already done so, you will need to upgrade these before you can safely
use BFU.  If BFU fails because it tries to upgrade a package that is not
available, please check the release notes for your build for information
on the cause and solution to the problem.  If you don't find what you
need, send a message to <a href="mailto:opensolaris-help@opensolaris.org" target="_top">mailto:opensolaris-help@opensolaris.org</a>
describing the messages and the circumstances.
</p><p>
After BFU completes, you must resolve conflicts in configuration files
The BFU will complete, and if successful will leave you with some
warnings and a <code class="code">bfu#</code> prompt.  <span class="bold"><strong>YOU ARE NOT DONE!</strong></span>  You must now
resolve conflicts and reboot:
</p><pre class="programlisting">
bfu# acr
</pre><p>
If <code class="code">acr</code> fails or prints out warnings or errors, you will need to
resolve conflicts manually before rebooting.  See &lt;5.3 Using BFU to
Install ON&gt; for full details.  Otherwise, reboot:
</p><pre class="programlisting">
bfu# reboot
</pre><p>
As your system comes up, note the new kernel version.  The ON bits on
your system have been upgraded.
</p></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="_1_3_5_Mini_Projects"></a>1.3.5 Mini-Projects</h3></div></div></div><p>
These activities are intended to help developers gain familiarity with
the OpenSolaris tools and environment while at the same time making
useful contributions toward meeting their own needs and those of the
community.  We hope that by engaging in some of these mini-projects, new
developers will be exposed to OpenSolaris from a variety of directions
and will find inspiration for new improvements in the large body of
existing work.  The project suggestions are roughly ordered from
simplest to most complex; less experienced developers should find the
first several projects to be a good introduction to OpenSolaris, while
more experienced developers may wish to take on some of the more
challenging tasks.  Of course, all of these are only suggestions; you
are always free to work on any part of the system you wish.  We ask only
that you utilize the mailing lists to coordinate your activities with
others to reduce duplication of effort.
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>1 Start a blog</p><p>
Many developers keep notes, bookmarks, pointers to useful documentation,
and other historical materials in a notebook or journal.  As you become
more familiar with OpenSolaris, your notes and experiences along the way
will be valuable to you and to others in the community.  You can create
your own blog at any of a number of free blogging sites.  Suggestions
for topics include any observations you make, difficulties you
encounter, or ideas you dream up for improving OpenSolaris.  Writing
about your ideas and experiences in your blog forms a focal point for
wider community involvement and discussion, filing of bugs or RFEs, or
the creation of a new development project.
</p></li><li><p>2 Fix a simple bug</p><p>
Many bugs we track in OpenSolaris are low-priority issues that have
remained unfixed over a long period of time; they are not especially
difficult to fix, and their effects tend to be annoying rather than
catastrophic.  We have also identified bugs which are easily fixed with
the 'oss-bite-size' keyword, so that new developers can obtain up to
date starting points.
</p><p>
You can view information about these bugs and search for bite-sized bugs
at <a href="http://bugs.opensolaris.org" target="_top">http://bugs.opensolaris.org</a>.
</p></li><li><p>3 Enhance cstyle(1)</p><p>
Improve the automated C/C++ style checking tools cstyle(1) and hdrchk(1)
to implement more of the style guide requirements.  For example,
cstyle(1) could be improved to detect poor declarations of initialized
variables.  See <a href="ch07s02.html#_7_2_1_Automated_Style_Tools">7.2.1 Automated Style Tools</a> for more information.
</p></li><li><p>4 Clean up and modernize code</p><p>
Make more commands and libraries <a href="apa.html#_lint">lint</a>-clean.  Although the entire
kernel (uts/...) lints without warnings, many commands and libraries are
excluded from linting because they contain lint errors.  Correcting
these errors is usually not difficult; start by enabling lint (see
<a href="ch03s03.html#_3_3_3_Modifying_the_ON_Build_S">3.3.3 Modifying the ON Build System</a>) and re-linting the command or
library in question.  In some cases it may be difficult or impossible to
fix a particular lint error, and that error must be disabled instead.
You can discuss such situations on the relevant mailing list.
</p></li><li><p>5 Simplify Install(1) usage</p><p>
Improve Install(1)'s '-i' option to use official platform names in
addition to code names when building kernel packages for specific
platforms.  See <a href="ch05s02.html">5.2 Using Cap-Eye-Install to Install Kernels</a> for more
information.
</p></li><li><p>6 Fix something that bothers you</p><p>
Search for and fix a bug in a program you use frequently, or that you
have noticed yourself.  You can search for bugs at
<a href="http://bugs.opensolaris.org" target="_top">http://bugs.opensolaris.org</a>.  Many bugs may already be undergoing
fixes, so you should avoid duplication of effort by mailing
<a href="mailto:request-sponsor@opensolaris.org" target="_top">mailto:request-sponsor@opensolaris.org</a> when you start working on a
bug fix.  The sponsors make sure nobody else is working on the bug, and
help you make sure you follow the right process to get your fix
integrated.
