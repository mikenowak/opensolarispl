This chapter describes several flexible methods for installing your ON
bits.  Please note that because ON does not include all the programs
needed for a working system, you must have an existing full install
(typically Solaris or Solaris Express) before you can perform these
procedures successfully.
</p><p>
Additionally, some of the common testing procedures for the kernel and
core userland components are covered.  Although these tests are intended
to cover as much of the system as possible, and to be flexible enough
that additional tests can be written and added to the infrastructure,
most testing is still done by project-specific test suites.  When
fixing bugs or adding new features, you are well-advised to contact the
owner(s) of the code you are changing to obtain any existing tests.  You
should also contribute new tests that detect the bug you are fixing or
verify the functionality of your new features.
</p><div class="sect1" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="_5_1_Installation_Overview"></a>5.1 Installation Overview</h2></div></div></div><p>
Other than manually copying specific files from your proto area into
your live system, there are three main ways to install your bits on your
system.  Which one you use will depend on what you have changed: if you
have changed only the kernel, see section 5.1.1 to learn about Install.
If you have changed the kernel and userland components of <a href="apa.html#_ON">ON</a> and
your changes must be applied together, you must either hand-copy your
userland changes before using Install, or use BFU; see section 5.3 for
information on BFU.
</p><p>
To accommodate fully functional builds even though some sources are
missing, a set of closed binaries is available, and the build system has
been modified to make use of them.  You will need to use the
closed-bins.&lt;platform&gt;.tar.gz components along with your build products
to build either Install or BFU archives that work.  Please see <a href="ch04.html">Building OpenSolaris</a> and the latest Release Notes for more information
on building and the use of the closed binaries.
</p><p>
Each of these installation methods is progressively more complex and
time-consuming, but upgrades a larger part of your system.  Because most
ON developers only modify the ON sources and are not responsible for
integration testing, BFU is by far the most popular method for
performing system upgrades.  Developers working heavily on the kernel
will often make use of Install during development and use BFU to keep
current between testing phases.
</p><p>
Each method is described briefly in this section.  Detailed
instructions are provided in sections 5.2 and 5.3.

Install (pronounced cap-eye-install) is used to update only the kernel
and its associated modules on a specific system.  It will place the
new kernel in a nonstandard location and install only the
platform-specific modules for your particular host.  This allows you
to test your changes without removing the normal kernel; if your new
kernel does not boot or crashes, this makes recovery much easier.
</p></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="_5_1_2_BFU"></a>5.1.2 BFU</h3></div></div></div><p>
BFU is used to update all <a href="apa.html#_ON">ON</a> bits, both kernel and userland.  It
is capable of updating some configuration files and is aware of the
impact of the changes that have been made to ON.  BFU is more thorough
than Install, and takes longer.  Also, unlike Install, the new kernel
will be installed over the existing one, so if it does not work properly
you may have to boot from alternate media to recover.

In some cases, you will need to install newer versions of one or more
system packages before you will be able to use a new version of the
<a href="apa.html#_ON">ON</a> bits.  When this happens, it is known as a Flag Day.  Flag Day
notices will be posted at <a href="http://opensolaris.org/os/community/onnv/" target="_top">http://opensolaris.org/os/community/onnv/</a>
and will include instructions for building and/or installing the newer
software you will need.  It should be noted that this installation
procedure is not guaranteed to interoperate cleanly with the standard
packaging tools such as pkgadd(1M).  In particular, use of BFU (see
section 4.1.4) or ad-hoc replacement of Solaris components means that
those components can no longer be updated using Solaris packages.  If
this is of concern to you, we recommend that you utilize exclusively
Solaris Express for managing your system package installation, and build
and test only against the source tree current at the time of the latest
Express build.  You can
