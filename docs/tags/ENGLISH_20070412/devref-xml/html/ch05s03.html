The Blindingly Fast Upgrade (or Bonwick-Faulkner Upgrade) is a process
used to update <a href="apa.html#_ON">ON</a> bits on a system.  The ordinary Solaris upgrade
procedure requires the complete <a href="apa.html#_WOS">WOS</a> and takes at least 30 minutes
(usually much longer).  To save time, BFU uses a set of cpio(1) archives
to directly overwrite the existing contents of the system.  BFU often
takes less than 10 minutes to run to completion, and if you are
upgrading from a recent build, conflict resolution will usually take
only a few minutes.  Over the course of a year, using BFU can save
dozens of hours of development time.
</p><p>
In order to use BFU, you will need to set three additional environment
variables first.  You can set these in your login dot-files, or on the
command line.  If you prefer, you could create a local wrapper for
bfu(1) that sets them first.  The environment variables are:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>FASTFS</p><p>
This should normally be set to /opt/onbld/bin/`uname -p`/fastfs.
</p></li><li><p>BFULD</p><p>
This should normally be set to /opt/onbld/bin/`uname -p`/bfuld.
</p></li><li><p>GZIPBIN</p><p>
This should normally be set to /usr/bin/gzip.
</p></li></ul></div><p>
BFU is simple to use and normally takes only a single argument: a path
to the set of archives you wish to install.  For example, if your
<a href="apa.html#_workspace">workspace</a> is located in /home/jdoe/workspace, and you have completed
a nightly(1) build, you would invoke bfu(1) as follows:
</p><pre class="programlisting">
# bfu /home/jdoe/workspace/archives/`uname -p`/nightly
</pre><p>
Note that, since it modifies the system software installation, bfu(1)
must always be run as root.
</p><p>
When bfu completes there's no guarantee that the new commands and
libraries are compatible with the currently running (old) kernel.
Therefore, instead of exiting, bfu puts you into a subshell in which
PATH=/tmp/bfubin and LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/tmp/bfulib.  These directories
contain the old versions of the commands and libraries commonly needed
to resolve conflicts and reboot the system.  They have also been
modified to work with a saved copy of the old dynamic linker.
</p><p>
Note that you may receive warnings from BFU about being unable to copy
files from "greenline.eng" or other systems or locations.  In general,
these warnings should be reported as bugs.  However, at the time of this
writing, they are harmless provided that your system is running at least
Solaris 10 build 74 prior to your BFU attempt.  See the latest release
notes for any additional requirements and restrictions.
</p><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="_5_3_1_Caveats"></a>5.3.1 Caveats</h3></div></div></div><p>
Although it saves time, BFU is not a panacea.  This section contains
information about BFU's drawbacks.  You should carefully evaluate these
drawbacks against the benefits and decide whether BFU is appropriate to
your needs.  In general, unless you are an active developer, we
recommend that you do not use BFU.
</p><p>
BFU does not update package information.  Therefore you will most likely
be unable to install official Solaris patches or run a full system
upgrade procedure on a system which has been BFU'd.  The importance of
this cannot be overemphasized: <span class="bold"><strong>IF YOU BFU YOUR SYSTEM, DO NOT ATTEMPT
TO USE "NORMAL" SYSTEM MANAGEMENT PROCEDURES TO UPDATE IT IN THE FUTURE.
USE BFU OR REINSTALL</strong></span>.
</p><p>
BFU does not update non-<a href="apa.html#_ON">ON</a> packages, even if newer versions of
those packages are required in order to successfully install or run the
version of ON you are installing.  You may need to update those packages
before and/or after running BFU.  To understand what package updates may
be needed, consult <a href="http://opensolaris.org/os/community/onnv/" target="_top">http://opensolaris.org/os/community/onnv/</a> for
the full list of flag days between the build you are currently running
and the build you wish to BFU to.  Each flag day notice will instruct
you as to what package updates, if any, are needed, and whether they
must be completed before or after BFUing.  It is critical that you read,
understand, and follow these instructions exactly before running BFU.
If you fail to do so you will almost certain <a href="apa.html#_brickify">brickify</a> your system.
See section 5.1.3 for more information about flag days.
</p><p>
Although the core functionality of BFU consists of the simple activity
of unpacking cpio(1) archives into the running system, it also performs
numerous other tasks related to the update of your system.  Many of
these tasks are specific to particular changes that have been made in
the sources over a period of years.  If your system has unusual
characteristics, these additional updates can fail, which may result in
a nonfunctional system.  Because these updates vary greatly, it is
impossible to know in advance which updates could fail, or what failure
modes are possible.  Although such failures are rare, they can occur.
If you use BFU, you should follow the development of ON to understand
changes being made that could have an adverse effect on your system.  If
you have doubts as to how well BFU will update a particular aspect of
your system following a major change to ON, read bfu(1) and consult with
the engineers who made the change.
</p><p>
When bfu finishes, it invokes ksh with a limited PATH.  The PATH
contains programs which have been specially modified to work regardless
of what changes the BFU archives may contain.  You can use these
programs to resolve conflicts (see section 5.3.2).  In particular,
"reboot" works, but "init 6" does not.  You can exit from this protected
environment if you want, but it is not advisable unless you are sure
that there have not been any "flag days" (synchronized kernel/userland
changes) since your last bfu.
</p><p>
Never BFU in a window; always use the system console.  If BFU or the
system crashes in midstream, or you use the window system and it crashes
or hangs, your system will be in an inconsistent state.  You may be
unable to boot.  Therefore, you should ensure that as much of the system
as possible is quiescent before starting a BFU, and be sure you have a
copy of suitable system software media handy to reinstall if necessary.
</p><p>
Never BFU a production system.  Production systems should always be
updated to approved releases using the supported upgrade mechanism.
</p></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="_5_3_2_Resolving_Conflicts"></a>5.3.2 Resolving Conflicts</h3></div></div></div><p>
Every machine has several configuration files which get modified from
the default installation; bfu keeps a list of these.  This list is known
as the conflicts database.
</p><p>
BFU saves a copy of each configuration file it would overwrite under
/bfu.child; likewise, it stores a copy of each such file from the cpio
archives it is extracting under /bfu.parent, having moved the previous
BFU's /bfu.parent (if any) to /bfu.ancestor.  We refer to the files
saved under those directories as the child, parent and ancestor
respectively.
</p><p>
When the extraction is complete, BFU diffs the various versions of
these configuration files and acts according to the following rules:
</p><p>
* If the file is unchanged (i.e., there is no difference between
the child and the parent), there is nothing to do or report.
</p><p>
* If the file was accepted from the parent the previous run
(i.e., the child is identical to the ancestor) then the parent
is accepted automatically this time; such files are marked as
"update:".
</p><p>
* If the file is the same as the beginning of the previous file,
it is assumed that the user has added lines to the end (i.e.,
the child consists of the parent plus some added lines); the
child version is restored; such files are marked as
"restore:".
</p><p>
* If the file differs between the parent and the child, but the
parent and ancestor are identical, then it is deemed an old
conflict; such files are marked as "old:".
</p><p>
* Lastly, if the file differs between the parent and the child,
and the parent and ancestor differ as well, then it is deemed
a NEW conflict; such files are marked as "NEW:".
</p><p>
So now we know that a NEW conflict means a file which was already
different from the default, where the default has been updated. To
resolve this difference, whatever changes were introduced in the new
build must be ported to the existing file on the system.
</p><p>
Although it is possible to blindly accept the parent, this will cause
any customizations in the child to be lost.  As it is very common for
these files to have such customizations made automatically by class
action scripts from non-<a href="apa.html#_ON">ON</a> packages, this is usually a mistake,
which can lead to hours of lost productivity.  Therefore, there are two
forms of conflict resolution which are discussed in the following two
sections.  They are automatic and manual conflict resolution.
</p><p>
If you elect to resolve conflicts manually, or if the automatic tools
are unable to resolve all conflicts, you will benefit from having a
proper BFU baseline installation.  To establish such a baseline, you
should install BFU archives corresponding to your distribution
immediately after installing it.  It is strongly recommended that you
begin this process only if your installation is sufficiently recent that
such BFU archives are available.  In particular, <span class="bold"><strong>BFUing a system older
than Solaris 11 build 16 will fail and may render your system
unbootable.</strong></span>
</p><p>
When BFUing to the same build as your distribution include, you can
ignore all conflicts, since your existing installed configuration files
are known to work correctly for this build.  You must then reboot before
BFUing to a later build.
</p><div class="sect3" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="_5_3_2_1_Automatic_Conflict_Res"></a>5.3.2.1 Automatic Conflict Resolution</h4></div></div></div><p>
Automatic conflict resolution is performed by a script called <span class="emphasis"><em>acr</em></span>.  This
script is available in /opt/onbld/bin and in the usr/src/tools/scripts
directory of the <a href="apa.html#_ON">ON</a> workspace.  In the usr/src/tools/scripts directory,
the acr executable gets made from acr.sh if you do a nightly(1) build with
the -t option.  There is man page, acr.1, in /opt/onbld/man/man1 and in the
usr/src/tools/scripts directory of the <a href="apa.html#_ON">ON</a> workspace.
</p><p>
The standard way to use acr is to invoke it while still in the protected
environment after a BFU is performed.  In this mode there is no need to
specify any command line parameters.
</p><p>
For more specialized applications, acr accepts one or two parameters.  The
first parameter is the name of an alternate root directory.  The second
parameter, if specified, is the name of the directory containing the
archives.
</p><p>
acr uses a file called conflict_resolution.gz in the directory containing
the BFU cpio archives.  This conflict resolution file is constructed
whenever nightly(1) creates archives.  That is to say whenever nightly(1)
is run with the -a option.
</p><p>
When acr runs, it lists the files that it is processing to standard out.
Detailed results are written to a file called <span class="emphasis"><em>allresults</em></span> in a
subdirectory of /tmp.  When acr exits, it prints the full path name of the
allresults file.  The allresults should be examined to ensure that no
errors occurred during acr processing.  If errors occurred, you will need
to resort to manual conflict resolution discussed in the next section.
</p></div><div class="sect3" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="_5_3_2_2_Manual_Conflict_Resolu"></a>5.3.2.2 Manual Conflict Resolution</h4></div></div></div><p>
Manual conflict resolution requires you to resolve each of the conflicts by
hand.  The general way to resolve conflicts is:
</p><pre class="programlisting">
% diff /bfu.ancestor/$file /bfu.parent/$file
</pre><p>
then manually apply the diffs to /$file.  Note that you will not have
<code class="code">/bfu.ancestor</code> if you have not previously BFU'd; therefore you will
find manual conflict resolution easier if you have established a
baseline as described above.  For many files, a short-cut can be
employed.  BFU drops you in /bfu.conflicts when it completes, and most
changes are additions or modifications, so doing:
</p><pre class="programlisting">
% diff $file /$file
</pre><p>
and making sure the diffs all point to the right (i.e., "&gt;" rather
than "&lt;") will do the trick.  This will not work in all cases,
however; some notable exceptions are detailed below.
</p><p>
<span class="bold"><strong>etc/name_to_major</strong></span>
</p><p>
This file matches device names with major numbers; it is critical that
each device have a unique major number.  Diffing the ancestor with the
parent is a good start -- just remember that the name is important, but
the major number may vary.  Old devices which have been removed in the
parent should be deleted, but if you're not sure, just leave them alone
as they are generally harmless.  New devices should be added with an
unused major number (if it's available, use the one from the diffs).
Never change the number for an existing entry unless you are sure you
know what you are doing.  If you are in doubt as to what changed, you
can consult the history of the files directly from your <a href="apa.html#_workspace">workspace</a>
(e.g. usr/src/uts/{intel|sparc}/os/name_to_major).
</p><p>
Once finished, you can sanity-check your changes by running:
</p><pre class="programlisting">
% sort -k1,1 /etc/name_to_major | sort -uc -k1,1
% sort -k2n /etc/name_to_major | sort -uc -k2n
</pre><p>
These report the first duplicated device name and the lowest
duplicated major number, respectively.  Either of these
indicates a problem that you must correct before rebooting.
If there is no output, you're all set.  Note that the kernel
will also warn you of such conflicts after you reboot, but by
then it may be too late.
</p><p>
<span class="bold"><strong>etc/security/*_attr</strong></span>
</p><p>
These files tend to get shuffled around quite a bit by
class-action scripts, so the parent and child versions can
differ wildly. For these, the shortcut described above is
ineffective, but the more general diff of the ancestor with
the parent works well.
</p><p>
In general, only NEW conflicts need to be examined.
</p></div></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="_5_3_3_BFU_and_Zones"></a>5.3.3 BFU and Zones</h3></div></div></div><p>
The contents of each zone are copied from the global zone when the zone
is created.  To ensure that all zones remain operational after BFUing,
it is necessary to keep the zone contents consistent with those in the
global zone.  To do this, BFU will update each zone in turn once the
global zone has been updated; however, because each zone may have
configuration files that differ from the global zone's, each zone has
its own BFU conflict management directories.  Unfortunately, it is not
possible to BFU only a single zone.  BFU affects the entire system
including all zones.  If you want to test userspace changes in a zone,
you will need to copy files from your proto area into that zone
manually.
</p><p>
It is safest to shut down all zones before BFUing your system.  This
will ensure that dependencies which may be violated by the files being
installed will not break a zone.
</p><p>
After BFUing a system with zones other than the global zone, you will
need to first resolve conflicts in the global zone, then resolve
conflicts in each remaining zone before rebooting the system.
Resolving BFU conflicts in a zone works exactly the same way as for
the global zone; however, in many cases it will not be necessary to
manually merge the file contents.  Instead you are likely to find that
the file should be identical to that in the global zone, and you can
simply copy it over.  After resolving conflicts in all zones, you must
reboot your system before rebooting any zone.
