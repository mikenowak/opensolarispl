This chapter provides information on standards and procedures which must
be followed by all developers.  These rules are the same ones which Sun
engineers have been required to follow when developing Solaris, and are
the primary reason Solaris, and now OpenSolaris, is among the world's
best available software.  These standards generally apply to all
consolidations.
</p><div class="sect1" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="_7_1_Compatibility_and_Visibili"></a>7.1 Compatibility and Visibility Constraints</h2></div></div></div><p>
OpenSolaris has a comprehensive set of rules governing interfaces.  An
interface is any aspect of the system that a user or developer can
observe or use.  Examples include functions and variables in libraries,
the location of a particular executable program, the output content,
format, and argument semantics of an executable program, and the
location in the filesystem of a header file.  There are thousands of
interfaces provided by OpenSolaris, and each of them has certain
visibility, documentation, and compatibility constraints.
</p><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="_7_1_1_Interface_Stability_Taxo"></a>7.1.1 Interface Stability Taxonomy</h3></div></div></div><p>
One of the attributes included in many Solaris man pages is "Interface
Stability."  The value of this attribute defines who may depend on the
interface, and what expectations they may have for its future
maintenance.  The possible values and their explanations are described
here; note that the Private levels will not appear in man pages shipped
to customers.
</p><p>
In the absence of any evidence about an interface's stability level,
certain assumptions must be made.  Following the general rule "be strict
in what you produce, and liberal in what you accept" would lead one to
conclude that any documented interface is Stable, and undocumented
interfaces are probably being used by others, but could be changed at
any time without your knowledge (i.e.  they are at once both Project
Private and Unstable); as a consequence you should neither change the
interface nor depend on its current implementation.  If you need to
depend on or change an undocumented interface whose stability level
cannot be determined, you need to find that interface's owner, if any,
and have the action approved by the relevant ARC.  If the owner of the
interface can be found, you will most likely want to promote the
interface either to Open (public) status, or use one of the Contracted
Private stability levels.
</p><p>
Following is a list of stability levels and their respective meanings.
Additional information is available in the attributes(5) man page,
including the precise public definitions of major, minor, and micro
releases and additional information about Open interfaces.
</p><p>
<span class="bold"><strong>Stability Level: Standard</strong></span>
</p><pre class="programlisting">

----------------------------------------------------------------
</pre><p>
Most of these interfaces are defined by a formal standard, and
controlled by a standards organization.  Incompatible changes to these
interfaces are rare.
</p><p>
This stability classification can also apply to interfaces that have
been adopted (without a formal standard) by an "industry convention"
(X/Open, MIT X-Consortium, OMG), or even by a single-source (Adobe's
Display PostScript, Novell's NetWare Protocols, Legato's network backup
protocols, Berkeley's sendmail) if we expect that the de facto standard
is unlikely to change incompatibly.
</p><p>
If possible, there should still be a reference to a standard
specification or reference system, although there may be cases where no
such citation is possible.  Customers are normally pointed to the same
specification.
</p><p>
Support is only provided for specific version(s) of a standard, and
support for a particular version does not guarantee that support will be
provided for other versions.  Sometimes bugs are corrected or
interpretation is clarified in a standard; we may make incompatible
changes to react to these, but will evaluate the impact of doing so and
will announce a compatibility and migration strategy. (PSARC/1995/224's
Advisory Information section provides guidelines for implementing a
preliminary draft of a new standard.)
</p><p>
Some standards lack bindings to a specific programming language; if the
project team chose names, numbers, extensions, or other
implementation-specific details, they should be called out for
architectural review.

</pre><p>
We publish the specification of these interfaces, typically as manual
pages or other product documentation.  We also tell customers we will
remain compatible with them.
</p><p>
The intention of a Stable interface is to enable arbitrary third parties
to develop applications to these interfaces, release them, and have
confidence that they will run on all minor releases of the product
(after the one in which the interface was introduced, and within the
same major release), without having to change or recompile the
applications.  Even at a major release, incompatible changes are
expected to be rare, and to have strong justifications.  Stable
interfaces are sometimes proposed to be industry Standards, as was the
case with ToolTalk (now an X/Open standard).
</p><p>
An ARC should review and archive the specification, and adequate
customer documentation must also exist.
</p><p>
These are interfaces whose specification is generally controlled within
OpenSolaris, and does not rely on externally delivered projects.
</p><p>
<span class="bold"><strong>Stability Level: Evolving</strong></span>

Compatible Change	minor release (x.Y)

----------------------------------------------------------------
</pre><p>
An Evolving interface is subject to incompatible change at a major or
minor release, but we should expect to change an Evolving interface only
carefully, and probably slowly.  As the interface evolves, we will make
reasonable efforts to ensure that all changes are source and binary
compatible.
</p><p>
An ARC should review the interface specification (especially with
respect to ability to absorb expected evolution compatibly).  Adequate
customer documentation should also exist.  The intention of an Evolving
interface is to enable ISV's to exploit new technology, and it should be
expected that they will ship products that depend on these interfaces.
As a result, any incompatible change to an Evolving interface requires
an assessment of potential customer impact, and a notification and
migration plan.  Elements of such a plan might include:
</p><p>
* clearly setting customer expectations about the circumstances
under which the interfaces might change.
</p><p>
* ensuring that all such changes are described in the release notes
for the affected release.
</p><p>
* providing migration aids for binary compatibility and/or continued
source development.
</p><p>
A project's intention to accept the risk of depending on an Evolving
interface must be evaluated and explicitly approved by an ARC.
</p><p>
NOTE: It will often be the case that interfaces declared to be Evolving
will later be reclassified as Stable or Standard.  Nonetheless, foreseen
promotion is not a necessary attribute of the Evolving taxonomy level.
An interface could be classified Evolving and remain as such
indefinitely.
</p><p>
<span class="bold"><strong>Stability Level: Unstable</strong></span>
</p><pre class="programlisting">
----------------------------------------------------------------
Specification		Open
----------------------------------------------------------------
Incompatible Change	minor release (x.Y)
----------------------------------------------------------------
Compatible Change	micro release (x.y.Z)
----------------------------------------------------------------
ARC review of Specs	Yes
----------------------------------------------------------------
Examples		SUNW* package abbreviations,
			some config utils
----------------------------------------------------------------
</pre><p>
Unstable interfaces are experimental or transitional.  They are
typically used to give developers early access to new or rapidly
changing technology, or to provide an interim solution to a problem
where a more general solution is anticipated.  No claims are made about
either source or binary compatibility from one minor release to the
next.
</p><p>
The intention of an Unstable interface is that they be imported only by
prototypes and by products on the same CD (or whatever release medium)
as the interface implementation.  A project's intention to import an
Unstable interface should be discussed with the ARC early.  The
stability classification of the interface -- or a replacement interface
-- might be raised.  The opinion allowing any project to import an
Unstable interface should explain why it is acceptable.
</p><p>
Any documentation for an Unstable interface must contain warnings that
these interfaces are subject to change without warning and should not be
used in unbundled products.  In some situations, it may be appropriate
to document Unstable interfaces in White Papers rather than in standard
product documentation.
</p><p>
Given such caveats, customer impact need not be a factor when
considering incompatible changes to an Unstable interface in a major or
minor release.  Nonetheless, when such changes are introduced, the
changes should still be mentioned in the release notes for the affected
release.
</p><p>
An ARC should review and archive the specification.  Any proposed change
to the interface must be ARC approved.
</p><p>
NOTE: If we choose to offer a draft standard implementation but state
our intention to track the standard (or the portions we find technically
sound or likely to be standardized), we set customer expectations for
incompatible changes by classifying the interface Unstable.  The
interface should be reclassified Standard when standard is final.  Such
an intention could be encoded "Unstable-&gt;Standard".)
</p><p>
<span class="bold"><strong>Stability Level: External</strong></span>
</p><pre class="programlisting">

</pre><p>
These interfaces are controlled by a body outside of OpenSolaris, but
unlike Standard, it can not be asserted that an incompatible change to
the interface would be exceedingly rare.  In some cases it may not even
be possible to clearly identify the controlling body.  This
classification is typically used for third-party open source components
integrated wholesale into an OpenSolaris consolidation.
</p><p>
Use of the External interface stability level allows freeware interfaces
provided by Sun to quickly track the fluid, external specification.  In
many cases, this is preferred to providing additional stability to the
interface, as it tends to track the expectations of the community.
However, External interfaces should adhere to OpenSolaris standards in
at least the following areas:
</p><p>
* Security, Authentication
* Manual Page Section Numbering
* File System Semantics (/usr may be read-only, /var is where all
significant run-time growth occurs, ...)
</p><p>
All External interfaces should be labeled as such in all associated
documentation and the consequence of using such interfaces should be
explained either as part of that documentation or by reference.  Default
search paths should not lead to External interfaces - the user should be
required to take some simple, explicit action to access them.
</p><p>
Shipping incompatible change in a patch should be strongly avoided.  It
is not strictly prohibited for the following two reasons:
</p><p>
* Since we are not in explicit control of the changes, we can not
guarantee with reasonable assurance that an unidentified
incompatibility isn't present.
</p><p>
* A strong business case may exist for shipping a newer version as a
patch if that newer version closes significant escalations.
</p><p>
In general, the intent of allowing change in a patch is to allow for
change in Update Releases.
</p><p>
It should be noted that in some cases it will be preferable to apply a
less fluid interface classification to an interface even if the
controlling body is external to OpenSolaris.  Use of the Unstable
classification extends the stability commitment over micro/patch
releases, allowing use of additional support models for software that
depends upon these interfaces, at the potential cost of less frequent
updates.  However, care should be exercised because it will be difficult
to differentiate External and Unstable as a classification for seemingly
identical software.  It is suggested to use External and behave (through
contracts) as Unstable.  Use of the Evolving classification promotes
these interfaces to first class OpenSolaris interfaces, at the potential
cost of diverging from the external specification.  By using Evolving,
we are essentially taking control of the interface, although it may
liberally import from the external reference.  Use of the Stable
classification is not recommended.
</p><p>
<span class="bold"><strong>Stability Level: Contracted External</strong></span>
</p><p>
This stability level is the same as External, except that a contract has
been put in place between the provider and consumer of the interface.
The contract describes special arrangements made for the stability of
the interface.  This can be used, for example, to place restrictions on
how and when an interface may change if the normal rules for External do
not satisfy the requirements of the consumer.
</p><p>
An ARC should review, approve, and archive a contract between the
provider and consumer of the interface.  Any change to the contract, the
interface, or the specification requires reapproval.
</p><p>
<span class="bold"><strong>Stability Level: Obsolete</strong></span>
</p><pre class="programlisting">
----------------------------------------------------------------
Specification		Open, along with warning of obsolescence
----------------------------------------------------------------
Incompatible Change	minor release (x.Y)
----------------------------------------------------------------
Compatible Change	By former classification, but unlikely
----------------------------------------------------------------
ARC review of Specs	Normally downgraded from a higher
			stability; ARC approval of interface or
			feature removal is also required.
----------------------------------------------------------------
Examples		RFS, System-V LP protocol
----------------------------------------------------------------
</pre><p>
An interface that is "deprecated" and/or no longer in general use.  An
existing interface may be downgraded from some other status (such as
Stable or Standard) to Obsolete to encourage customers to migrate from
that interface before it will be removed (or incompatibly changed).
</p><p>
In addition to reclassifying the interface Obsolete and documenting the
new classification in customer documentation, a pro-active program to
communicate to customers the change in commitment must precede the
incompatible change or removal in a minor release.  For some interfaces,
the ARC may find such a communication program appropriate before
removing an interface, even at a major release.
</p><p>
The standard program to communicate a change in commitment requires:
</p><p>
1. Demonstration of support by the Steering Committee responsible for
the deliverable(s) containing the interface. Such support can be
demonstrated by a change to strategy document or resolutions taken in
meetings and documented in the minutes.
</p><p>
2. One year's notice to the customer base and the Sun product
development community of the intended obsolescence of the interface.
This requirement ensures that no further commitments against the
interface are created and gives those affected by future removal of the
facility a chance to make alternative arrangements.
</p><p>
The year must elapse after the notice and prior to the delivery of
a product that contains a change incompatible with the present status of
the interface.
</p><p>
Acceptable means of customer notice includes letters to customers
on support contracts, release notes or product documentation, or
announcements to customer forums appropriate for the interface in
question.
</p><p>
The notice of obsolescence is considered to be "public"
information in that it is available freely to the customers.  It is not
intended that this require specific actions to "publish" the
information, such as press releases or similar forms of publicity.
</p><p>
3. Where technically feasible, inclusion in the release where the
interface is declared Obsolete of a warning mechanism if the interface
is used.  The mechanism should produce a message of the form "The
application uses interface which has been declared obsolete and may not
be present in versions of released after [event].  Please notify your
support person.  See in [reference] for more information."  One
suggested method is to use syslog(3), with a level of "LOG_WARNING".  A
method for turning off the warning message should also be provided.
Common sense should apply in determining how often the warning should
appear.
</p><p>
4. Information in the User Documentation that contains the following:
</p><p>
* An explanation of the meaning of Obsolete.
</p><p>
* An indication of the kinds of warning messages that may appear.
</p><p>
* A suggesting that the customer ask their support person to
contact the vendor of any application that causes such a
warning to appear.
</p><p>
* General instructions for turning off the warning messages.
</p><p>
* A list of the Obsolete interfaces contained in this release,
the earliest that they may disappear, the kind of warning
that might appear, and the method for disabling the warning.
</p><p>
Proposals to downgrade an interface through this mechanism must be
approved by an ARC before "core" documentation may be altered to
identify the interface as Obsolete.  Release notes may warn of the
possibility of removal with either ARC or Steering Committee approval.
A warning that the interface *may* be removed in a future release could
be included without ARC approval, but the ARC may not deem such notice
alone as sufficient notification to customers to "start the 1-year
clock".
</p><p>
A follow-on project to perform the actual feature removal in a
forthcoming minor or major release after the timeout period expires,
requires architectural approval to ensure that the requirements of the
obsolescence policy have been met.  Provided they have been met,
approval will be straightforward.

For some otherwise-private interfaces, we must maintain compatibility
from release to release, in order to meet the customer's expectations
for compatibility of the programs using these interfaces.  However, we
don't want customers to depend on these interfaces directly, and we
don't want to directly expose these interfaces to customers.  These
interfaces are classified as Committed Private.
</p><p>
Our commitment is that a customer's "normal" use of system facilities
should not allow them to see any incompatible changes to these
interfaces.  Since these interfaces typically span machines by being
embodied in media or protocols (and since customers cannot upgrade all
their machines simultaneously), these interfaces can't be changed with
the freedom of a private interface.  Yet, changes to the details of the
interface can be dramatic, provided the commitment to the customer is
maintained.  In general, Committed Private interfaces should be
versioned.
</p><p>
An ARC should review and archive the specification, and will at least
assure that the interface can satisfy its purpose and support the
evolution described in the previous paragraph.  Any proposed change to
or new dependency on the interface must be ARC approved.
</p><p>
<span class="bold"><strong>Stability Level: Contracted Committed Private</strong></span>
</p><p>
This stability level is the same as Committed Private, except that a

exposure of the interface to a Sun Partner.

These are interfaces which one <a href="apa.html#_consolidation">consolidation</a> depends on and another
consolidation provides.  Changes to these interfaces must be coordinated
among all providers and users of the interface.  Some internal kernel
interfaces are Sun Private interfaces.
</p><p>
Interfaces are occasionally made Sun Private in order to gain some
experience with them before opening them up to wider use as Unstable or
Stable interfaces.  Making such interfaces Consolidation Private would
be preferable, however, as evolution is then far easier.
</p><p>
Sun Private interfaces are strongly discouraged.  Coordinating changes
to these interfaces within a consolidation is usually feasible, but
coordinating changes among different consolidations released
asynchronously is extremely difficult.  Interface versioning is advised
for Sun Private interfaces.
</p><p>
An ARC will review and archive these interfaces, with special attention
to how the interface could evolve, if necessary.  Any proposed change to

</pre><p>
These are interfaces internal to the consolidation that one piece of a
consolidation depends on and another piece of the same consolidation
provides.  Changes to these interfaces must be coordinated among all
providers and users of the interface.  Many internal kernel interfaces
are Consolidation Private interfaces.
</p><p>
Generally these are interfaces that have proven convenient for building
the consolidation, but which change often enough that we're not willing
to document them for external use nor to commit to their stability.
libdeskset is an example of such an interface.  Though the libkvm API is
Public, the undocumented names that can be accessed through that
interface are Consolidation or Project Private.
</p><p>
An ARC may review and archive these interfaces, or may leave the
consolidation to monitor their own internal commitments.  If a
Consolidation Private interface is reviewed by the ARC, ask that ARC if
they want to review later changes to that interface.
</p><p>
Importing the interface by any project outside the Consolidation would
require negotiating a "contract" with the interface providers.  An ARC
must review and approve the classification change to Contracted
Consolidation Private and the terms of the contract.

Examples		Metamucil ioctls, nfssys system call,
			uadmin cpu control functions
----------------------------------------------------------------
</pre><p>
Project Private interfaces usually occur when a project must communicate
between its components across a boundary in the system.  For instance,
Metamucil includes several new ioctls to perform operations on UFS
filesystems.  The Metamucil ufsdump program uses these ioctls.  The
ioctls are private interfaces since they are intended to be used only by
the Metamucil product.  If the Metamucil product needs to change these
ioctls in the future, they can do so without coordinating with any other
projects, since no other projects may use these ioctls.  Likewise, the
nfssys system call is used to communicate between the kernel- and
user-level portions of NFS.
</p><p>
Project Private interfaces also occur in libraries where one module
needs to call a private routine in another module in the same library.
</p><p>
Also, Project Private interfaces may be provisional or in transition.
The uadmin cpu control functions are Project Private because they will
change form before appearing as Standard interfaces, and in the meantime
we don't want anyone depending on them.
</p><p>
Sadly, many kernel procedures are Project Private interfaces (instead of
Internal interfaces) because they are visible to dynamically loaded
kernel modules.
</p><p>
Once an interface is classified Project Private by an ARC, changes to
that interface need not be ARC approved.
</p><p>
Any use of the interface from outside the project would involve
negotiating a "contract" with the interface providers; an ARC must
review and approve the classification change to Contracted Project
Private and the terms of the contract.

Libraries delivered by ON contain symbol versioning information that
limits the exposure of private interfaces and provides tracking of
