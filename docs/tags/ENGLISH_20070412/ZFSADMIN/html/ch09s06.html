<p>This section describes how to determine device failure types, clear
transient errors, and replace a device.</p>
<div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="gbbzs"></a>Determining the Type of Device Failure</h3></div></div></div>

<p>The term <span class="emphasis"><em>damaged device</em></span> is rather vague, and can
describe a number of possible situations:<a class="indexterm" name="indexterm-540"></a>
<a class="indexterm" name="indexterm-541"></a>
<a class="indexterm" name="indexterm-542"></a>
</p>
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li>
<p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Bit rot</strong></span> &#8211; Over time,
random events, such as magnetic influences and cosmic rays, can cause bits
stored on disk to flip in unpredictable events. These events are relatively
rare but common enough to cause potential data corruption in large or long-running
systems. These errors are typically transient.</p>
</li><li>
<p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Misdirected reads or writes</strong></span> &#8211;
Firmware bugs or hardware faults can cause reads or writes of entire blocks
to reference the incorrect location on disk. These errors are typically transient,
though a large number might indicate a faulty drive.</p>
</li><li>
<p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Administrator error</strong></span> &#8211;
Administrators can unknowingly overwrite portions of the disk with bad data
(such as copying <code class="filename">/dev/zero</code> over portions
of the disk) that cause permanent corruption on disk. These errors are always
transient.</p>
</li><li>
<p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Temporary outage</strong></span>&#8211;
A disk might become unavailable for a period time, causing I/Os to fail. This
situation is typically associated with network-attached devices, though local
disks can experience temporary outages as well. These errors might or might
not be transient.</p>
</li><li>
<p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Bad or flaky hardware</strong></span> &#8211;
This situation is a catch-all for the various problems that bad hardware exhibits.
This could be consistent I/O errors, faulty transports causing random corruption,
or any number of failures. These errors are typically permanent.</p>
</li><li>
<p>
<span class="strong"><strong>Offlined device</strong></span> &#8211;
If a device is offline, it is assumed that the administrator placed the device
in this state because it is presumed faulty. The administrator who placed
the device in this state can determine is this assumption is accurate.</p>
</li></ul></div>
<p>Determining exactly what is wrong can be a difficult process. The first
step is to examine the error counts in the <span><strong class="command">zpool status</strong></span> output
as follows:</p>
<pre class="screen"># <strong class="userinput"><code>zpool status -v</code></strong> <em class="replaceable"><code>pool</code></em>
</pre>
<p>The errors are divided into I/O errors and checksum errors, both of
which might indicate the possible failure type. Typical operation predicts
a very small number of errors (just a few over long periods of time). If you
are seeing large numbers of errors, then this situation probably indicates
impending or complete device failure. However, the pathology for administrator
error can result in large error counts. The other source of information is
the system log. If the log shows a large number of SCSI or fibre channel driver
messages, then this situation probably indicates serious hardware problems.
If no syslog messages are generated, then the damage is likely transient.</p>
<p>The goal is to answer the following question:</p>
<p>
<span class="emphasis"><em>Is another error likely to occur on this device?</em></span>
</p>
<p>Errors that happen only once are considered <span class="emphasis"><em>transient</em></span>,
and do not indicate potential failure. Errors that are persistent or severe
enough to indicate potential hardware failure are considered &#8220;fatal.&#8221;
The act of determining the type of error is beyond the scope of any automated
software currently available with ZFS, and so much must be done manually by
you, the administrator. Once the determination is made, the appropriate action
can be taken. Either clear the transient errors or replace the device due
to fatal errors. These repair procedures are described in the next sections.</p>
<p>Even if the device errors are considered transient, it still may have
caused uncorrectable data errors within the pool. These errors require special
repair procedures, even if the underlying device is deemed healthy or otherwise
repaired. For more information on repairing data errors, see <span class="olink">Repairing Damaged Data</span>.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="gbbzv"></a>Clearing Transient Errors</h3></div></div></div>

<p>If the device errors are deemed transient, in that they are unlikely
to effect the future health of the device, then the device errors can be safely
cleared to indicate that no fatal error occurred. To clear error counters
for RAID-Z or mirrored devices, use the <span><strong class="command">zpool clear</strong></span> command.
For example:<a class="indexterm" name="indexterm-543"></a>
<a class="indexterm" name="indexterm-544"></a>
<a class="indexterm" name="indexterm-545"></a>
</p>
<pre class="screen"># <strong class="userinput"><code>zpool clear tank c1t0d0</code></strong>
</pre>
<p>This syntax clears any errors associated with the device and clears
any data error counts associated with the device.</p>
<p>To clear all errors associated with the virtual devices in the pool,
and clear any data error counts associated with the pool, use the following
syntax:</p>
<pre class="screen"># <strong class="userinput"><code>zpool clear tank</code></strong>
</pre>
<p>For more information about clearing pool errors, see <span class="olink">Clearing Storage Pool Devices</span>.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="gbbzy"></a>Replacing a Device in a ZFS Storage Pool</h3></div></div></div>

<p>If device damage is permanent or future permanent damage is likely,
the device must be replaced. Whether the device can be replaced depends on
the configuration.</p>
<div class="sect3" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="gbcfb"></a>Determining if a Device Can Be Replaced</h4></div></div></div>

<p>For a device to be replaced, the pool must be in the <code class="literal">ONLINE</code> state.
The device must be part of a replicated configuration, or it must be healthy
(in the <code class="literal">ONLINE</code> state). If the disk is part of a replicated
configuration, sufficient replicas from which to retrieve good data must exist.
If two disks in a four-way mirror are faulted, then either disk can be replaced
because healthy replicas are available. However, if two disks in a four-way
RAID-Z device are faulted, then neither disk can be replaced because not enough
replicas from which to retrieve data exist. If the device is damaged but otherwise
online, it can be replaced as long as the pool is not in the <code class="literal">FAULTED</code> state.
However, any bad data on the device is copied to the new device unless there
are sufficient replicas with good data.<a class="indexterm" name="indexterm-546"></a>
<a class="indexterm" name="indexterm-547"></a>
<a class="indexterm" name="indexterm-548"></a>
</p>
<p>In the following configuration, the disk <code class="literal">c1t1d0</code> can
be replaced, and any data in the pool is copied from the good replica, <code class="literal">c1t0d0</code>.</p>
<pre class="screen">mirror            DEGRADED
    c1t0d0             ONLINE
    c1t1d0             FAULTED</pre>
<p>The disk <code class="literal">c1t0d0</code> can also be replaced, though no self-healing
of data can take place because no good replica is available.</p>
<p>In the following configuration, neither of the faulted disks can be
replaced. The <code class="literal">ONLINE</code> disks cannot be replaced either, because
the pool itself is faulted.</p>
<pre class="screen">raidz             FAULTED
    c1t0d0             ONLINE
    c2t0d0             FAULTED
    c3t0d0             FAULTED
    c3t0d0             ONLINE</pre>
<p>In the following configuration, either top-level disk can be replaced,
though any bad data present on the disk is copied to the new disk.</p>
<pre class="screen">c1t0d0         ONLINE
c1t1d0         ONLINE</pre>
<p>If either disk were faulted, then no replacement could be performed
because the pool itself would be faulted.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect3" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="gbcdv"></a>Unreplaceable Devices</h4></div></div></div>

<p>If the loss of a device causes the pool to become faulted, or the device
contains too many data errors in an unreplicated configuration, then the device
cannot safely be replaced. Without sufficient replicas, no good data with
which to heal the damaged device exists. In this case, the only option is
to destroy the pool and re-create the configuration, restoring your data in
the process.</p>
<p>For more information about restoring an entire pool, see <span class="olink">Repairing ZFS Storage Pool-Wide Damage</span>.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect3" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="gbcet"></a>Replacing a Device</h4></div></div></div>

<p>Once you have determined that a device can be replaced, use the <span><strong class="command">zpool
replace</strong></span> command to replace the device. If you are replacing the
damaged device with another different device, use the following command:<a class="indexterm" name="indexterm-549"></a>
<a class="indexterm" name="indexterm-550"></a>
<a class="indexterm" name="indexterm-551"></a>
</p>
<pre class="screen"># <strong class="userinput"><code>zpool replace tank c1t0d0 c2t0d0</code></strong>
</pre>
<p>This command begins migrating data to the new device from the damaged
device, or other devices in the pool if it is in a replicated configuration.
When the command is finished, it detaches the damaged device from the configuration,
at which point the device can be removed from the system. If you have already
removed the device and replaced it with a new device in the same location,
use the single device form of the command. For example:</p>
<pre class="screen"># <strong class="userinput"><code>zpool replace tank c1t0d0</code></strong>
</pre>
<p>This command takes an unformatted disk, formats it appropriately, and
then begins resilvering data from the rest of the configuration.</p>
<p>For more information about the <span><strong class="command">zpool replace</strong></span> command,
see <span class="olink">Replacing Devices in a Storage Pool</span>.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect3" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="gbcus"></a>Viewing Resilvering Status</h4></div></div></div>

<p>The process of replacing a drive can take an extended period of time,
depending on the size of the drive and the amount of data in the pool. The
process of moving data from one device to another device is known as <span class="emphasis"><em>resilvering</em></span>, and can be monitored by using the <span><strong class="command">zpool status</strong></span> command.</p>
<p>Traditional file systems resilver data at the block level. Because ZFS
eliminates the artificial layering of the volume manager, it can perform resilvering
in a much more powerful and controlled manner. The two main advantages of
this feature are as follows:</p>
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li>
<p>ZFS only resilvers the minimum amount of necessary data. In
the case of a short outage (as opposed to a complete device replacement),
the entire disk can be resilvered in a matter of minutes or seconds, rather
than resilvering the entire disk, or complicating matters with &#8220;dirty
region&#8221; logging that some volume managers support. When an entire disk
is replaced, the resilvering process takes time proportional to the amount
of data used on disk. Replacing a 500-Gbyte disk can take seconds if only
a few gigabytes of used space is in the pool.<a class="indexterm" name="indexterm-552"></a>
<a class="indexterm" name="indexterm-553"></a>
<a class="indexterm" name="indexterm-554"></a>
</p>
</li><li>
<p>Resilvering is interruptible and safe. If the system loses
power or is rebooted, the resilvering process resumes exactly where it left
off, without any need for manual intervention.</p>
</li></ul></div>
<p>To view the resilvering process, use the <span><strong class="command">zpool status</strong></span> command.
For example:</p>
<pre class="screen"># <strong class="userinput"><code>zpool status tank</code></strong>
  pool: tank
 state: DEGRADED
reason: One or more devices is being resilvered.
action: Wait for the resilvering process to complete.

          mirror              DEGRADED     0     0     0
            replacing         DEGRADED     0     0     0  52% resilvered
              c1t0d0          ONLINE       0     0     0
              c2t0d0          ONLINE       0     0     0  
            c1t1d0            ONLINE       0     0     0</pre>
<p>In this example, the disk <code class="literal">c1t0d0</code> is being replaced
by <code class="literal">c2t0d0</code>. This event is observed in the status output
by presence of the <span class="emphasis"><em>replacing</em></span> virtual device in the configuration.
This device is not real, nor is it possible for you to create a pool by using
this virtual device type. The purpose of this device is solely to display
the resilvering process, and to identify exactly which device is being replaced. </p>
<p>Note that any pool currently undergoing resilvering is placed in the <code class="literal">DEGRADED</code> state, because the pool cannot provide the desired replication
level until the resilvering process is complete. Resilvering proceeds as fast
as possible, though the I/O is always scheduled with a lower priority than
user-requested I/O, to minimize impact on the system. Once the resilvering
is complete, the configuration reverts to the new, complete, configuration.
For example:</p>
<pre class="screen"># <strong class="userinput"><code>zpool status tank</code></strong>
  pool: tank
 state: ONLINE
 scrub: scrub completed with 0 errors on Tue Mar  7 15:27:36 2006
