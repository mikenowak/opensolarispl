<p>No <span><strong class="command">fsck</strong></span> utility equivalent exists for ZFS. This utility
has traditionally served two purposes, data repair and data validation.</p>
<div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="gbbyc"></a>Data Repair</h3></div></div></div>

<p>With traditional file systems, the way in which data is written is inherently
vulnerable to unexpected failure causing data inconsistencies. Because a traditional
file system is not transactional, unreferenced blocks, bad link counts, or
other inconsistent data structures are possible. The addition of journaling
does solve some of these problems, but can introduce additional problems when
the log cannot be rolled back. With ZFS, none of these problems exist. The
only way for inconsistent data to exist on disk is through hardware failure
(in which case the pool should have been replicated) or a bug in the ZFS software
exists.<a class="indexterm" name="indexterm-505"></a>
<a class="indexterm" name="indexterm-506"></a>
<a class="indexterm" name="indexterm-507"></a>
</p>
<p>Given that the <span><strong class="command">fsck</strong></span> utility is designed to repair
known pathologies specific to individual file systems, writing such a utility
for a file system with no known pathologies is impossible. Future experience
might prove that certain data corruption problems are common enough and simple
enough such that a repair utility can be developed, but these problems can
always be avoided by using replicated pools.</p>
<p>If your pool is not replicated, the chance that data corruption can
render some or all of your data inaccessible is always represent.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="gbbyd"></a>Data Validation</h3></div></div></div>

<p>In addition to data repair, the <span><strong class="command">fsck</strong></span> utility validates
that the data on disk has no problems. Traditionally, this task is done by
unmounting the file system and running the <span><strong class="command">fsck</strong></span> utility,
possibly taking the system to single-user mode in the process. This scenario
results in downtime that is proportional to the size of the file system being
checked. Instead of requiring an explicit utility to perform the necessary
checking, ZFS provides a mechanism to perform regular checking of all data.
This functionality, known as <span class="emphasis"><em>scrubbing</em></span>, is commonly used
in memory and other systems as a method of detecting and preventing errors
before they result in hardware or software failure.<a class="indexterm" name="indexterm-508"></a>

<div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="gbbxi"></a>Controlling ZFS Data Scrubbing</h3></div></div></div>

<p>Whenever ZFS encounters an error, either through scrubbing or when accessing
a file on demand, the error is logged internally so that you can get a quick
overview of all known errors within the pool. <a class="indexterm" name="indexterm-511"></a>
<a class="indexterm" name="indexterm-512"></a>
</p>
<div class="sect3" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="gbbws"></a>Explicit ZFS Data Scrubbing</h4></div></div></div>

<p>The simplest way to check your data integrity is to initiate an explicit
scrubbing of all data within the pool. This operation traverses all the data
in the pool once and verifies that all blocks can be read. Scrubbing proceeds
as fast as the devices allow, though the priority of any I/O remains below
that of normal operations. This operation might negatively impact performance,
though the file system should remain usable and nearly as responsive while
the scrubbing occurs. To initiate an explicit scrub, use the <span><strong class="command">zpool
scrub</strong></span> command. For example:<a class="indexterm" name="indexterm-513"></a>
<a class="indexterm" name="indexterm-514"></a>
<a class="indexterm" name="indexterm-515"></a>
</p>
<pre class="screen"># <strong class="userinput"><code>zpool scrub tank</code></strong>
</pre>
<p>The status of the current scrub can be displayed in the <span><strong class="command">zpool
status</strong></span> output. For example:</p>
<pre class="screen"># <strong class="userinput"><code>zpool status -v tank</code></strong>
  pool: tank
 state: ONLINE
 scrub: scrub completed with 0 errors on Tue Mar  7 15:27:36 2006
config:

        NAME         STATE     READ WRITE CKSUM
        tank         ONLINE       0     0     0
          mirror     ONLINE       0     0     0
            c1t0d0   ONLINE       0     0     0
            c1t1d0   ONLINE       0     0     0

errors: No known data errors</pre>
<p>Note that only one active scrubbing operation per pool can occur at
one time.</p>
<p>Performing regular scrubbing also guarantees continuous I/O to all disks
on the system. Regular scrubbing has the side effect of preventing power management
from placing idle disks in low-power mode. If the system is generally performing
I/O all the time, or if power consumption is not a concern, then this issue
can safely be ignored.</p>

<div class="sect3" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="gbbya"></a>ZFS Data Scrubbing and Resilvering</h4></div></div></div>

<p>When a device is replaced, a resilvering operation is initiated to move
data from the good copies to the new device. This action is a form of disk
scrubbing. Therefore, only one such action can happen at a given time in the
pool. If a scrubbing operation  is
in progress, a resilvering operation suspends the current scrubbing, and restarts
after the resilvering is complete.<a class="indexterm" name="indexterm-516"></a>
