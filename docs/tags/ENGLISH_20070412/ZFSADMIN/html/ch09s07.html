<p>ZFS uses checksumming, replication, and self-healing data to minimize
the chances of data corruption. Nonetheless, data corruption can occur if
the pool isn't replicated, if corruption occurred while the pool was degraded,
or an unlikely series of events conspired to corrupt multiple copies of a
piece of data. Regardless of the source, the result is the same: The data
is corrupted and therefore no longer accessible. The action taken depends
on the type of data being corrupted, and its relative value. Two basic types
of data can be corrupted:</p>
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li>
<p>Pool metadata &#8211; ZFS requires a certain amount of data
to be parsed to open a pool and access datasets. If this data is corrupted,
the entire pool or complete portions of the dataset hierarchy will become
unavailable.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Object data &#8211; In this case, the corruption is within
a specific file or directory. This problem might result in a portion of the
file or directory being inaccessible, or this problem might cause the object
to be broken altogether.</p>
</li></ul></div>
<p>Data is verified during normal operation as well as through scrubbing.
For more information about how to verify the integrity of pool data, see <span class="olink">Checking ZFS Data Integrity</span>.</p>
<div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="gbcuz"></a>Identifying the Type of Data Corruption</h3></div></div></div>

<p>By default, the <span><strong class="command">zpool status</strong></span> command shows only that
corruption has occurred, but not where this corruption occurred. For example:<a class="indexterm" name="indexterm-555"></a>
<a class="indexterm" name="indexterm-556"></a>
<a class="indexterm" name="indexterm-557"></a>
</p>
<pre class="screen"># <strong class="userinput"><code>zpool status tank -v</code></strong>
   pool: tank
	 state: ONLINE
	status: One or more devices has experienced an error resulting in data
		     corruption.  Applications may be affected.
	action: Restore the file in question if possible.  Otherwise restore the
		     entire pool from backup.
	   see: http://www.sun.com/msg/ZFS-8000-8A
	 scrub: none requested
	config:

		NAME         STATE     READ WRITE CKSUM
		tank         ONLINE       1     0     0
		  mirror     ONLINE       1     0     0
		    c2t0d0   ONLINE       2     0     0
		    c1t1d0   ONLINE       2     0     0

	errors: The following persistent errors have been detected:

		  DATASET  OBJECT  RANGE
		  tank     6       0-512</pre>
<p>Each error indicates only that an error occurred at the given point
in time. Each error is not necessarily still present on the system. Under
normal circumstances, this situation is true. Certain temporary outages might
result in data corruption that is automatically repaired once the outage ends.
A complete scrub of the pool is guaranteed to examine every active block in
the pool, so the error log is reset whenever a scrub finishes. If you determine
that the errors are no longer present, and you don't want to wait for a scrub
to complete, reset all errors in the pool by using the <span><strong class="command">zpool online</strong></span> command.</p>
<p>If the data corruption is in pool-wide metadata, the output is slightly
different. For example:</p>
<pre class="screen"># <strong class="userinput"><code>zpool status -v morpheus</code></strong>
  pool: morpheus
    id: 1422736890544688191
 state: FAULTED
status: The pool metadata is corrupted.
action: The pool cannot be imported due to damaged devices or data.
   see: http://www.sun.com/msg/ZFS-8000-72
config:

        morpheus    FAULTED   corrupted data
          c1t10d0   ONLINE</pre>
<p>In the case of pool-wide corruption, the pool is placed into the <code class="literal">FAULTED</code> state, because the pool cannot possibly provide the needed replication
level.</p>

<p>If a file or directory is corrupted, the system might still be able
to function depending on the type of corruption. Any damage is effectively
unrecoverable. No good copies of the data exist anywhere on the system. If
the data is valuable, you have no choice but to restore the affected data
from backup. Even so, you might be able to recover from this corruption without
restoring the entire pool.<a class="indexterm" name="indexterm-558"></a>
<a class="indexterm" name="indexterm-559"></a>
<a class="indexterm" name="indexterm-560"></a>
</p>
<p>If the damage is within a file data block, then the file can safely
be removed, thereby clearing the error from the system. The first step is
to try removing the file with the <span><strong class="command">rm</strong></span> command. If this command
doesn't work, the corruption is within the file's metadata, and ZFS cannot
determine which blocks belong to the file in order to remove the corruption.</p>
<p>If the corruption is within a directory or a file's metadata, the only
choice is to move the file elsewhere. You can safely move any file or directory
to a less convenient location, allowing the original object to be restored
in place.</p>

<div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="gbctt"></a>Repairing ZFS Storage Pool-Wide Damage</h3></div></div></div>

<p>If the damage is in pool metadata that damage prevents the pool from
being opened, then you must restore the pool and all its data from backup.
The mechanism you use varies widely by the pool configuration and backup strategy.
First, save the configuration as displayed by <span><strong class="command">zpool status</strong></span> so
that you can recreate it once the pool is destroyed. Then, use <span><strong class="command">zpool
destroy</strong></span> <code class="option">
f</code> to destroy the pool. Also, keep a file
describing the layout of the datasets and the various locally set properties
somewhere safe, as this information will become inaccessible if the pool is
ever rendered inaccessible. With the pool configuration and dataset layout,
you can reconstruct your complete configuration after destroying the pool.
The data can then be populated by using whatever backup or restoration strategy
you use.<a class="indexterm" name="indexterm-561"></a>
