<p>The Solaris ZFS file system is a revolutionary new file system that
fundamentally changes the way file systems are administered, with features
and benefits not found in any other file system available today. ZFS has been
designed to be robust, scalable, and simple to administer.<a class="indexterm" name="indexterm-1"></a>

<div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="gaypk"></a>ZFS Pooled Storage</h3></div></div></div>

<p>ZFS uses the concept of <span class="emphasis"><em>storage pools</em></span> to manage
physical storage. Historically, file systems were constructed on top of a
single physical device. To address multiple devices and provide for data redundancy,
the concept of a <span class="emphasis"><em>volume manager</em></span> was introduced to provide
the image of a single device so that file systems would not have to be modified
to take advantage of multiple devices. This design added another layer of
complexity and ultimately prevented certain file system advances, because
the file system had no control over the physical placement of data on the
virtualized volumes.<a class="indexterm" name="indexterm-2"></a>
<a class="indexterm" name="indexterm-3"></a>
</p>
<p>ZFS eliminates the volume management altogether. Instead of forcing
you to create virtualized volumes, ZFS aggregates devices into a storage pool.
The storage pool describes the physical characteristics of the storage (device
layout, data redundancy, and so on,) and acts as an arbitrary data store from
which file systems can be created. File systems are no longer constrained
to individual devices, allowing them to share space with all file systems
in the pool. You no longer need to predetermine the size of a file system,
as file systems grow automatically within the space allocated to the storage
pool. When new storage is added, all file systems within the pool can immediately
use the additional space without additional work. In many ways, the storage
pool acts as a virtual memory system. When a memory DIMM is added to a system,
the operating system doesn't force you to invoke some commands to configure
the memory and assign it to individual processes. All processes on the system
automatically use the additional memory.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="gaypi"></a>Transactional Semantics</h3></div></div></div>

<p>ZFS is a transactional file system, which means that the file system
state is always consistent on disk. Traditional file systems overwrite data
in place, which means that if the machine loses power, for example, between
the time a data block is allocated and when it is linked into a directory,
the file system will be left in an inconsistent state. Historically, this
problem was solved through the use of the <span><strong class="command">fsck</strong></span> command.
This command was responsible for going through and verifying file system state,
making an attempt to repair any inconsistencies in the process. This problem
caused great pain to administrators and was never guaranteed to fix all possible
problems. More recently, file systems have introduced the concept of <span class="emphasis"><em>journaling</em></span>. The journaling process records action in a separate journal,
which can then be replayed safely if a system crash occurs. This process introduces
unnecessary overhead, because the data needs to be written twice, and often
results in a new set of problems, such as when the journal can't be replayed
properly.<a class="indexterm" name="indexterm-4"></a>
<a class="indexterm" name="indexterm-5"></a>
</p>
<p>With a transactional file system, data is managed using <span class="emphasis"><em>copy
on write</em></span> semantics. Data is never overwritten, and any sequence
of operations is either entirely committed or entirely ignored. This mechanism
means that the file system can never be corrupted through accidental loss
of power or a system crash. So, no need for a <span><strong class="command">fsck</strong></span> equivalent
exists. While the most recently written pieces of data might be lost, the
file system itself will always be consistent. In addition, synchronous data
(written using the <code class="varname">O_DSYNC</code> flag) is always guaranteed to
be written before returning, so it is never lost.</p>

<div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="gaypb"></a>Checksums and Self-Healing Data</h3></div></div></div>

<p>With ZFS, all data and metadata is checksummed using a user-selectable
algorithm. Traditional file systems that do provide checksumming have performed
it on a per-block basis, out of necessity due to the volume management layer
and traditional file system design. The traditional design means that certain
failure modes, such as writing a complete block to an incorrect location,
can result in properly checksummed data that is actually incorrect. ZFS checksums
are stored in a way such that these failure modes are detected and can be
recovered from gracefully. All checksumming and data recovery is done at the
file system layer, and is transparent to applications.<a class="indexterm" name="indexterm-6"></a>
<a class="indexterm" name="indexterm-7"></a>
</p>
<p>In addition, ZFS provides for self-healing data. ZFS supports storage
pools with varying levels of data redundancy, including mirroring and a variation
on RAID-5. When a bad data block is detected, ZFS fetches the correct data
from another replicated copy, and repairs the bad data, replacing it with
the good copy.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="gayou"></a>Unparalleled Scalability</h3></div></div></div>

<p>ZFS has been designed from the ground up to be the most scalable file
system, ever. The file system itself is 128-bit, allowing for 256 quadrillion
zettabytes of storage. All metadata is allocated dynamically, so no need exists
to pre-allocate inodes or otherwise limit the scalability of the file system
when it is first created. All the algorithms have been written with scalability
in mind. Directories can have up to 2<sup>48</sup> (256 trillion)
entries, and no limit exists on the number of file systems or number of files
that can be contained within a file system.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="gbcbn"></a>ZFS Snapshots</h3></div></div></div>

<p>A <span class="emphasis"><em>snapshot</em></span> is a read-only copy of a file system
or volume. Snapshots can be created quickly and easily. Initially, snapshots
consume no additional space within the pool.</p>
<p>As data within the active dataset changes, the snapshot consumes space
by continuing to reference the old data. As a result, the snapshot prevents
the data from being freed back to the pool.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="gayoc"></a>Simplified Administration</h3></div></div></div>

<p>Most importantly, ZFS provides a greatly simplified administration model.
Through the use of hierarchical file system layout, property inheritance,
and automanagement of mount points and NFS share semantics, ZFS makes it easy
to create and manage file systems without needing multiple commands or editing
configuration files. You can easily set quotas or reservations, turn compression
on or off, or manage mount points for numerous file systems with a single
command. Devices can be examined or repaired without having to understand
a separate set of volume manager commands. You can take an unlimited number
of instantaneous snapshots of file systems. You can backup and restore individual
file systems.<a class="indexterm" name="indexterm-8"></a>
<a class="indexterm" name="indexterm-9"></a>
</p>
<p>ZFS manages file systems through a hierarchy that allows for this simplified
management of properties such as quotas, reservations, compression, and mount
points. In this model, file systems become the central point of control. File
systems themselves are very cheap (equivalent to a new directory), so you
are encouraged to create a file system for each user, project, workspace,
and so on. This design allows you to define fine-grained management points.</p>
