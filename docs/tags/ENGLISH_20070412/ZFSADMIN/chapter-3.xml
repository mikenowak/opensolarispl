<title>ZFS and Traditional File System Differences</title>
<toc>
<para>This chapter discusses some significant differences between ZFS and
traditional file systems. Understanding these key differences can help reduce
confusion when using traditional tools to interact with ZFS.</para>

<title>ZFS File System Granularity</title>
<para>Historically, file systems have been constrained to one device so that
the file systems themselves have been constrained to the size of the device.
Creating and re-creating traditional file systems because of size constraints
are time-consuming and sometimes difficult. Traditional volume management
products helped manage this process.<indexterm xml:id="indexterm-69">

</para>
<para>Because ZFS file systems are not constrained to specific devices, they
can be created easily and quickly, similar to the way directories are created.
ZFS file systems grow automatically within the space allocated to the storage
pool.</para>
<para>Instead of creating one file system, such as <filename>/export/home</filename>,
to manage many user subdirectories, you can create one file system per user.
In addition, ZFS provides a file system hierarchy so that you can easily set
up and manage many file systems by applying properties that can be inherited
by file systems contained within the hierarchy.</para>
<para>For an example of creating a file system hierarchy, see <olink targetdoc="" remap="internal" targetptr="gaypa">Creating a ZFS File System Hierarchy</olink>.</para>

<sect1 xml:id="gbchp">
<title>ZFS Space Accounting</title>
<para>ZFS is based on a concept of pooled storage. Unlike typical file systems,
which are mapped to physical storage, all ZFS file systems in a pool share
the available storage in the pool. So, the available space reported by utilities
such as <command>df</command> might change even when the file system is inactive,
as other file systems in the pool consume or release space. Note that the
maximum file system size can be limited by using quotas. For information about
quotas, see <olink targetdoc="" remap="internal" targetptr="gazud">Setting Quotas on ZFS File Systems</olink>.
Space can be guaranteed to a file system by using reservations. For information
about reservations, see <olink targetdoc="" remap="internal" targetptr="gbdbb">Setting Reservations on ZFS File Systems</olink>. This model is very similar to the NFS model, where multiple
directories are mounted from the same file system (consider <filename>/home</filename>).<indexterm xml:id="indexterm-71">

</para>
<para>All metadata in ZFS is allocated dynamically. Most other file systems
pre-allocate much of their metadata. As a result, an immediate space cost
at file system creation for this metadata is required. This behavior also
means that the total number of files supported by the file systems is predetermined.
Because ZFS allocates its metadata as it needs it, no initial space cost is
required, and the number of files is limited only by the available space.
The output from the <command>df -g</command> command must be interpreted differently
for ZFS than other file systems. The <computeroutput>total files</computeroutput> reported
is only an estimate based on the amount of storage that is available in the
pool.</para>
<para>ZFS is a transactional file system. Most file system modifications are
bundled into transaction groups and committed to disk asynchronously. Until
these modifications are committed to disk, they are termed <emphasis>pending
changes</emphasis>. The amount of space used, available, and referenced by
a file or file system does not consider pending changes. Pending changes are
generally accounted for within a few seconds. Even committing a change to
disk by using <command>fsync(3c)</command> or <literal>O_SYNC</literal> does
not necessarily guarantee that the space usage information is updated immediately.</para>
<sect2 xml:id="gayra">
<title>Out of Space Behavior</title>
<para>File system snapshots are inexpensive and easy to create in ZFS. Most
likely, snapshots will be common in most ZFS environments. For information
about ZFS snapshots, see <olink targetdoc="" remap="internal" targetptr="gavvx">ChapterÂ 6, Working With ZFS Snapshots and Clones</olink>.</para>
<para>The presence of snapshots can cause some unexpected behavior when you
attempt to free space. Typically, given appropriate permissions, you can remove
a file from a full file system, and this action results in more space becoming
available in the file system. However, if the file to be removed exists in
a snapshot of the file system, then no space is gained from the file deletion.
The blocks used by the file continue to be referenced from the snapshot.<indexterm xml:id="indexterm-73">

</indexterm>
</para>
<para>As a result, the file deletion can consume more disk space, because
a new version of the directory needs to be created to reflect the new state
of the namespace. This behavior means that you can get an unexpected <errorname>ENOSPC</errorname> or <errorname>EDQUOT</errorname> when attempting to remove a
file.</para>

<title>Mounting ZFS File Systems</title>
<para>ZFS is designed to reduce complexity and ease administration. For example,
with existing file systems you must edit the <filename>/etc/vfstab</filename> file
every time you add a new file system. ZFS has eliminated this requirement
by automatically mounting and unmounting file systems according to the properties
of the dataset. You do not need to manage ZFS entries in the <filename>/etc/vfstab</filename> file.<indexterm xml:id="indexterm-75">

<title>Traditional Volume Management</title>
<para>As described in <olink targetdoc="" remap="internal" targetptr="gaypk">ZFS Pooled Storage</olink>,
ZFS eliminates the need for a separate volume manager. ZFS operates on raw
devices, so it is possible to create a storage pool comprised of logical volumes,
either software or hardware. This configuration is not recommended, as ZFS
works best when it uses raw physical devices. Using logical volumes might
sacrifice performance, reliability, or both, and should be avoided.<indexterm xml:id="indexterm-77">

<title>New Solaris ACL Model</title>
<para>Previous versions of the Solaris OS supported an ACL implementation
that was primarily based on the POSIX ACL draft specification. The POSIX-draft
based ACLs are used to protect UFS files. A new ACL model that is based on
the NFSv4 specification is used to protect ZFS files.<indexterm xml:id="indexterm-79">
