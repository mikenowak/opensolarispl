<title>Getting Started With ZFS</title>
<toc>
<para>This chapter provides step-by-step instructions on setting up simple
ZFS configurations. By the end of this chapter, you should have a basic idea
of how the ZFS commands work, and should be able to create simple pools and
file systems. This chapter is not designed to be a comprehensive overview
and refers to later chapters for more detailed information.</para>

<title>Creating a Basic ZFS File System</title>
<para>ZFS administration has been designed with simplicity in mind. Among
the goals of the ZFS design is to reduce the number of commands needed to
create a usable file system. When you create a new pool, a new ZFS file system
is created and mounted automatically.</para>
<para>The following example illustrates how to create a storage pool named <literal>tank</literal> and a ZFS file system name <filename>tank</filename> in one
command. Assume that the whole disk <filename>/dev/dsk/c1t0d0</filename> is
available for use.</para>
<screen># <userinput>zpool create tank c1t0d0</userinput>
</screen>
<para>The new ZFS file system, <filename>tank</filename>, can use as much
of the disk space on <systemitem>c1t0d0</systemitem> as needed, and is automatically
mounted at <filename>/tank</filename>.</para>
<screen># <userinput>mkfile 100m /tank/foo</userinput>
# <userinput>df -h /tank</userinput>

tank                   80G   100M    80G     1%    /tank</screen>
<para>Within a pool, you will probably want to create additional file systems.
File systems provide points of administration that allow you to manage different
sets of data within the same pool.</para>
<para>The following example illustrates how to create a file system named <literal>fs</literal> in the storage pool <literal>tank</literal>. Assume that the
whole disk <filename>/dev/dsk/c1t0d0</filename> is available for use.</para>

<title>Creating a ZFS Storage Pool</title>
<para>The previous example illustrates the simplicity of ZFS. The remainder
of this chapter demonstrates a more complete example similar to what you would
encounter in your environment. The first tasks are to identify your storage
requirements and create a storage pool. The pool describes the physical characteristics
of the storage and must be created before any file systems are created.</para>
<task xml:id="gayol">
<title>Identifying Storage Requirements</title>
<procedure>
<step>
<para>Determine available devices.</para>
<para>Before creating a storage
pool, you must determine which devices will store your data. These devices
must be disks of at least 128 Mbytes in size, and they must not be in use
by other parts of the operating system. The devices can be individual slices
on a preformatted disk, or they can be entire disks that ZFS formats as a
single large slice.<indexterm xml:id="indexterm-50">

<title>Creating a ZFS File System Hierarchy</title>
<para>After creating a storage pool to store your data, you can create your
file system hierarchy. Hierarchies are simple yet powerful mechanisms for
organizing information. They are also very familiar to anyone who has used
a file system.<indexterm xml:id="indexterm-55">

<secondary>ZFS file system hierarchy</secondary>
</indexterm>
<indexterm xml:id="indexterm-56">
<primary>file system hierarchy</primary>
<secondary>creating</secondary>
</indexterm>
</para>
<para>ZFS allows file systems to be organized into arbitrary hierarchies,
where each file system has only a single parent. The root of the hierarchy
is always the pool name. ZFS leverages this hierarchy by supporting property
inheritance so that common properties can be set quickly and easily on entire
trees of file systems.</para>
<task xml:id="gaypd">
<title>Determining the ZFS File System Hierarchy</title>
<procedure>
<step>
<para>Pick the file system granularity.</para>
<para>ZFS file systems
are the central point of administration. They are lightweight and can be created
easily. A good model to use is a file system per user or project, as this
model allows properties, snapshots, and backups to be controlled on a per-user
or per-project basis. </para>
<para>Two ZFS file systems, <filename>bonwick</filename> and <filename>billm</filename>, are created in <olink targetdoc="" remap="internal" targetptr="gayog">Creating ZFS File Systems</olink>.</para>
<para>For more information on managing file systems,
see <olink targetdoc="" remap="internal" targetptr="gavwq">Chapter 5, Managing ZFS File Systems</olink>.</para>
</step>
<step>
<para>Group similar file systems.</para>
<para>ZFS allows file systems
to be organized into hierarchies so that similar file systems can be grouped.
This model provides a central point of administration for controlling properties
and administering file systems. Similar file systems should be created under
a common name.</para>
<para>For the example in <olink targetdoc="" remap="internal" targetptr="gayog">Creating ZFS File Systems</olink>, the two file systems are placed under a file system
named <filename>home</filename>. </para>
</step>
<step>
<para>Choose the file system properties.</para>
<para>Most file system
characteristics are controlled by using simple properties. These properties
control a variety of behavior, including where the file systems are mounted,
how they are shared, if they use compression, and if any quotas are in effect. </para>
<para>For the example in <olink targetdoc="" remap="internal" targetptr="gayog">Creating ZFS File Systems</olink>,
all home directories are mounted at <filename>/export/zfs/</filename>
<replaceable>user</replaceable>, are shared by using NFS, and with compression enabled.
In addition, a quota of 10 Gbytes on <filename>bonwick</filename> is enforced.</para>
<para>For more information about properties, see <olink targetdoc="" remap="internal" targetptr="gazss">ZFS Properties</olink>.</para>

<para>Create the desired hierarchy.</para>
<para>In this example, a file

<para>Set the inherited properties.</para>
<para>After the file system
hierarchy is established, set up any properties that should be shared among

<para>Create the individual file systems.</para>
<para>Note that the

dynamically while file systems are in use.</para>
<screen># <userinput>zfs create tank/home/bonwick</userinput>
# <userinput>zfs create tank/home/billm</userinput>
</screen>
<para>These file systems inherit their property settings from their parent,
so they are automatically mounted at <filename>/export/zfs/</filename>
<replaceable>user</replaceable> and are NFS shared. You do not need to edit the <filename>/etc/vfstab</filename> or <filename>/etc/dfs/dfstab</filename> file.</para>
