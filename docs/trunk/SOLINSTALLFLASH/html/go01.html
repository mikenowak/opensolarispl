is a number between 0 and 225. However, the first number must be less than 224 and
the last number cannot be 0.</p><p>IP addresses are logically divided into two
parts: the network (similar to a telephone area code), and the local system on the
network (similar to a phone number). The numbers in a Class A IP address, for example,
represent &#8220;<code class="literal">network.local.local.local</code>&#8221; and the numbers
in a Class C IP address represent &#8220;<code class="literal">network.network.network.local</code>.&#8221;</p><div class="informaltable">
