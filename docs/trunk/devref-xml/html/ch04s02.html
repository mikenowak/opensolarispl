There are many steps in building any consolidation; ON's build process
entails creation of the proto area, compiling and linking binaries,
generating <a href="apa.html#_lint">lint</a> libraries and linting the sources, building packages
and BFU archives, and verifying headers, packaging, and proto area
changes.  Fortunately, a single utility called nightly(1) automates all
these steps and more.  It is controlled by a single environment file,
the format of which is shared with bldenv(1).  This section describes
what nightly(1) does for you, what it does not, and how to use it.
</p><p>
nightly(1) can automate most of the build and source-level checking
processes.  It builds the source, generates BFU archives,
generates packages, runs lint(1), does syntactic checks, and creates and
checks the proto area.  It does not perform any runtime tests such as
unit, functional, or regression tests; you must perform these
separately, ideally on dedicated systems.
</p><p>
Despite its name, nightly(1) can be run manually or by cron(1M) at any
time; you must run it yourself or arrange to have it run once for each
build you want to do.  nightly(1) does not start any daemons or
repetitive background activities: it does what you tell it to do, once,
and then stops.
</p><p>
After each run, nightly(1) will leave a detailed log of the commands it
ran and their output; this is normally located in
$CODEMGR_WS/log/log.MMDD/nightly.log, where MMDD is the date, but can be
changed as desired.  If such a log already exists, nightly(1) will
rename it for you.
</p><p>
In addition to the detailed log, you (actually, the address specified in
the MAILTO environment variable) will also receive an abbreviated
completion report when nightly(1) finishes.  This report will tell you
about any errors or warnings that were detected and how long each step
took to complete.  It will list errors and warnings as differences from
a previous build (if there is one); this allows you to see what effect
your changes, if any, has had.  It also means that if you attempt a
build and it fails, and you then correct the problems and rebuild, you
will see information like:
</p><pre class="programlisting">
&lt; dmake: Warning: Command failed for target `yppasswd'
&lt; dmake: Warning: Command failed for target `zcons'
&lt; dmake: Warning: Command failed for target `zcons.o'
&lt; dmake: Warning: Command failed for target `zdump'
</pre><p>
Note the '&lt;' - this means this output was for the previous build.  If
the output is prefaced with '&gt;', it is associated with the most recent
build.  In this way you will be able to see whether you have corrected
all problems or introduced new ones.

nightly(1) accepts a wide variety of options and flags that control its
behavior.  Many of these options control whether nightly(1) performs
each of the many steps it can automate for you.  These options may be
specified in the environment file or on the command line; options
specified on the command line take precedence.  See nightly(1) for the
complete list of currently accepted options and their effect on build
behavior.

nightly(1) reads a file containing a set of environment definitions for
the build.  This file is a simple shell script, but normally just
contains variable assignments.  All variables described in section <a href="ch02s05.html">2.5 Environment Variables</a> and below in <a href="ch04s02.html#_4_2_3_Variables">4.2.3 Variables</a> can be set in the
nightly(1) environment file; however, common practice is to use the
developer, or gatekeeper, or opensolaris environment files, as
appropriate, and modify one of them to meet your needs.  The name of the
resulting environment file is then passed as the final argument to
nightly(1).  The sample environment files are available in
usr/src/tools/env.

Although any environment variables can be set in a nightly(1)
environment file, this section lists those which are used directly by
nightly(1) to control its operation and which are commonly changed.  The
complete list of variables and options is found in nightly(1).
