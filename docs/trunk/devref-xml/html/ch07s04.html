The entire Solaris kernel and many libraries and commands are completely
lint clean, both pass1 and pass2.  It is important that we maintain this
cleanliness as yet another tool to insure a high quality release.
Although not all non-kernel code is lint-clean, new code should be, and
all new commands and libraries should be entirely lint-clean.
Lint-clean code should indicate to the build system that it should be
linted.  For an example of code in transition to lint-cleanliness, see
usr/src/cmd/cmd-inet/usr.sbin/Makefile and the associated code.
</p><p>
Before checking in your changes use the following steps (on both SPARC
and x86!) to check for any new errors:
</p><pre class="programlisting">
% cd $SRC/uts
% ( make &amp;&amp; make lint ) &gt; ERRS 2&gt;&amp;1
% grep "warning:" ERRS
</pre><p>
*ANY* warning messages must be fixed!
</p><p>
Note that you can also use nightly(1) to generate lint output.  If you
instruct nightly(1) to run lint, which you should always do by adding
'l' to your NIGHTLY_OPTIONS or explicitly using the '-l' command line
option, it will produce a listing of any "lint noise" as part of its
final output if your changes have introduced lint warnings; it should be
empty.  This can be much easier than looking through a log file as
described above, and includes any lint warnings from both kernel and
non-kernel code which is intended to be lint-clean.
</p><p>
In the build system, linting is fairly similar to a "normal" build, but
it has an additional complication.  In order to get meaningful output
from lint pass2, all the modules must be linted together. This is
accomplished by each module being responsible to produce its own pass1
output (file.ln, one per .c/.s file). It is also responsible for placing
the lint-library (llib-lMODULE) in the uts/MACHINE/lint-libs directory.
The final full lint is accomplished by the makefile in the uts/MACHINE
directory by linting all the lint-libraries against each other.
</p><p>
Note that, to keep lint happy about functions defined in assembly
only, there are also C prototypes in the .s files.  For example:
</p><pre class="programlisting">
#if defined(lint)
int
blort(int, int)
{ return 0 }
#else	/* lint */
</pre><pre class="programlisting">
ENTRY(blort)
ld	[%i0],....
....
SET_SIZE(blort)
</pre><pre class="programlisting">
#endif	/* lint */
</pre><p>
Here are some additional rules for keeping code lint-clean and avoiding
lint problems:
</p><p>
* *NEVER* *EVER* use /* LINTLIBRARY */ in OpenSolaris kernel source!
</p><p>
* Modification of header files, either directly or as a result of
a merge, does not always cause the lint libraries to be rebuilt.  This
may result in seemingly impossible errors of a function having two
different declarations. Be sure to run "make clean.lint" after any merge
or modification of a header file.
</p><p>
* When calling a function with a return value but not using it, place
a (void) cast in front.  Common functions are sprintf and strcpy.
Many times ignoring a function return value can hide error
conditions.  Functions that always have the values ignored might need
to consider having their specification redeclared void, although of
course this normally does not apply to public interfaces.
</p><p>
* Format strings for long integers use one of "%ld", %lx", or "%lu"
</p><p>
* Format strings for unsigned integers use one of "%u" or "%x"
</p><p>
* Format strings for long long integers use "%lld" or "%llx"
</p><p>
* Format strings for pointers should use "%p", with the pointer cast
to (void *).  Using %d or %x and casting to an (int) will break in a
64-bit kernel.
</p><p>
* For code that is supposed to work for either ILP32 or LP64, there
are some macros that you can use in the format string, so that you
don't need to #ifdef longs versus ints.  See &lt;sys/int_fmtio.h&gt;.
</p><p>
* Use full ANSI/ISO prototypes in function declarations, as the kernel is
always compiled with __STDC__ defined.  New code should not use
K&amp;R-style declarations.
</p><p>
* Make sure machine dependent function declarations are consistent
across platforms.
</p><p>
* Be sure you are linting against the headers in your proto area and not
the installed headers on your build machine.
