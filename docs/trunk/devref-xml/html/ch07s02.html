Like many engineering efforts, OpenSolaris enforces a coding style on
contributed code, regardless of its source.  This coding style is very
similar to that used by the Linux kernel, BSD systems, and many other
non-GNU projects (the GNU project uses its own unique coding style).
This style is described in detail at
<a href="http://opensolaris.org/os/community/onnv/" target="_top">http://opensolaris.org/os/community/onnv/</a>, although some elements
in the style guide are rather dated, especially as they relate to K&amp;R C
versus ANSI (now ISO) C.  You also should examine the files in
<code class="code">usr/src/prototypes</code>; these provide examples of the correct general
layout and style for most types of source files.

Two tools for checking many elements of the coding style are available
as part of the ON tools.  These tools are cstyle(1) for verifying
compliance of C code with most style guidelines, and hdrchk(1) for
checking the style of C and C++ headers.  Note that these tools are not
perfect; there are style mistakes that cannot be caught by any
reasonable tool, and others that cannot be caught by the particular
implementations.  Improving the accuracy and completeness of these tools
is an ongoing task and enhancements of all kinds are welcome.
</p><p>
All headers are expected to pass 'hdrchk'.  All C files and headers 
are expected to pass 'cstyle -P -p'.  These tools produce no output 
and exit with status code 0 if the file(s) checked meet the style 
requirements.
</p><p>
7.2.2 =head3 Style Examples
</p><p>
A few common examples of bad style which are not currently caught by the
tools include:
</p><p>
* Mixing declaration of initialized and uninitialized variables on the
same line; for example:
</p><pre class="programlisting">
int a, b = 16, c = -4, d;
</pre><p>
Instead, uninitialized variables may be declared one or more per line,
and each initialized variable should be declared on its own line:
</p><pre class="programlisting">
int a, d;
int b = 16;
int c = -4;
</pre><p>
or
</p><pre class="programlisting">
int a;
int b = 16;
int c = -4;
int d;
</pre><p>
* Inconsistent use of acceptable styles.  In the above
example, two acceptable ways to declare variables are presented.
Good style dictates that whichever is used by used everywhere within
a file; however, the tools do not check for such consistency.
</p><p>
* Incorrect placement and use of braces around if/else constructs.  The
heuristic test for this is not run by default, and is not completely
reliable.  For simplicity's sake, here is the correct format for
if/else in which both alternatives are compound statements:
</p><pre class="programlisting">
if (x != SOME_CONSTANT) {
	do_stuff();
	return (x);
} else {
	do_other_stuff();
	x = OTHER_CONSTANT;
}
</pre><p>
If neither alternative is a compound statement, use:
</p><pre class="programlisting">
if (x != SOME_CONSTANT)
	do_stuff();
else
	do_other_stuff();
</pre><p>
Finally, if only one alternative is a compound statement, both
alternatives should have braces, formatted as shown:
</p><pre class="programlisting">
if (x != SOME_CONSTANT) {
	do_stuff();
	return (x);
} else {
	do_other_stuff();
}
</pre><p>
Note the placement of braces; they should surround an "else" and only
the closing brace should be on a line by itself.
</p><p>
* Use of comments associated with conditional compilation directives.
It is good style to include trailing comments after #else and #endif
directives describing the condition it references; for example:
</p><pre class="programlisting">
#ifdef __FOO
...
#else	/* !__FOO */
...
#endif	/* !__FOO */
</pre><p>
The style tools do not check for the presence, usefulness, or
correctness of these trailing comments, but you should normally
include them, especially if the intervening code blocks are lengthy
or the tests are part of a complicated set of nested preprocessor
conditionals.
</p><p>
* Incorrect guards in header files.  Guard names should be derived
from the header name, but hdrchk does not check this.  For example, a
header installed in &lt;sys/scsi/foo_impl.h&gt; should have a guard as
follows:
</p><pre class="programlisting">
#ifndef _SYS_SCSI_FOO_IMPL_H
#define _SYS_SCSI_FOO_IMPL_H
...
#endif /* _SYS_SCSI_FOO_IMPL_H */
</pre><p>
However, hdrchk verifies neither the actual guard token name nor the
comment following #endif.
</p><p>
* Comment style is only partially checked.  For example, the correct
style for block comments is:
</p><pre class="programlisting">
/*
 * Some comment here.
 * More here.
 */
</pre><p>
cstyle(1) can detect some common errors, such as enclosing the entire
block comment in a box of asterisks or other characters.  However, it
cannot detect all such errors; for example:
</p><pre class="programlisting">
/*
   Some comment here.
   We conserve asterisks even though it's harder to read.
   Our comment is nonconforming.
 */
</pre><p>
Correct indentation of comments is also unchecked; block and
single-line comments within functions should be indented at the same
level as the code they document.  Trailing comments should be aligned
with other trailing comments in related code.  None of these style
guidelines is checked by the tools.
</p><p>
It probably goes without saying that the contents of comments aren't
checked in any way.  Please, be sure to follow the comment content
guidelines in the style guide.
</p></div><div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="_7_2_3_Non_Formatting_Considera"></a>7.2.3 Non-Formatting Considerations</h3></div></div></div><p>
cstyle(1) and hdrchk(1) will, in addition to several code-formatting
guidelines, verify compliance with SCCS keyword and copyright
requirements.  All files must be under SCCS control, and each must have
a set of keywords near the top (see the prototypes for the exact order
of file contents).  In general, the keywords should have the following
format in C files and headers:
</p><pre class="programlisting">
@PRAGMA_IDENT_EXP@
</pre><p>
Note that this string actually contains several embedded tabs; showing
these tabs as \t, the keywords look like:
</p><pre class="programlisting">
@PRAGMA_IDENT@
</pre><p>
Files which are not C (or C++) implementations or headers should
dispense with the "pragma" portion and just use #ident as follows:
</p><pre class="programlisting">
@IDENT@
</pre><p>
In addition, each file must contain a statement of copyright at the very
top.  The acceptable text and formats for these copyrights are shown in
the example files in usr/src/prototypes.  When a source file is
significantly updated, the year or range of years in the copyright
should be replaced with just the current year at the time of
modification.  Significant updates do not include formatting changes.
However, if you prefer not to think about whether your change
constitutes a significant update or if you don't trust your judgment,
erring on the side of always updating the year is acceptable.  Since the
prototypes assume that Sun is always the sole copyright holder, you will
need to change the copyright statement slightly; for example, if a file
initially contains:
</p><pre class="programlisting">
/*
 * Copyright (c) 1992-1998 by Sun Microsystems, Inc.
 * All rights reserved.
 */
</pre><p>
you should replace this notice with:
</p><pre class="programlisting">
/*
 * Copyright 2005 Sun Microsystems, Inc.
 * All rights reserved.  Use is subject to license terms.
 */
</pre><p>
and, if you are a contributor not employed by Sun, you should also add:
</p><pre class="programlisting">
/*
 * Copyright 2005 J. Random Hacker
 * All rights reserved.  Use is subject to license terms.
 */
</pre><p>
or a similar statement of your copyright.  Do not combine copyright
notices, and do not remove the existing copyright notices unless
specifically instructed to do so.

Before submitting any changes for code review prior to inclusion in
OpenSolaris, you should self-review your code for stylistic correctness
(as well as semantic correctness!).  Running the cstyle(1) and/or
hdrchk(1) tools is part of this process, but you should also be familiar
with the entire style guide so that you will be able to use correct
style even in elements that the tools do not check.  All new code must
be cstyle- and, if applicable, hdrchk-clean.  If you are modifying
existing code which does not conform to the style guide, your changes
should be conformant, and at worst your changes should not increase the
number of cstyle or hdrchk warnings.
