<p>By default, the size of a state database replica is 4 Mbytes
or 8192 blocks. You should create state database replicas on a dedicated slice
with at least 4 Mbytes per replica. Because your disk slices might not be
that small, you might want to resize a slice to hold the state database replica.
For information about resizing a slice, see <span class="olink">Chapter 12, <em class="citetitle">Administering Disks (Tasks),</em> in <em class="citetitle">System Administration Guide: Devices and File Systems</em>
</span>.</p>
</li><li>
<p>To avoid single points-of-failure, distribute state database
replicas across slices, drives, and controllers. You want a majority of replicas
to survive a single component failure. If you lose a replica (for example,
due to a device failure), problems might occur with running Solaris Volume Manager or
when rebooting the system. Solaris Volume Manager requires at least half of the replicas
to be available to run, but a majority (half + 1) to reboot into multiuser
mode.</p>
<p>A minimum of 3 state database replicas are recommended,
up to a maximum of 50 replicas per Solaris Volume Manager disk set. The following
guidelines are recommended:</p>
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="circle"><li>
<p>For a system with only a single drive: put all three replicas
on one slice.</p>
</li><li>
<p>For a system with two to four drives: put two replicas on
each drive.</p>
</li><li>
<p>For a system with five or more drives: put one replica on
each drive.</p>
</li></ul></div>
</li><li>
<p>If multiple controllers exist, replicas should be distributed
as evenly as possible across all controllers. This strategy provides redundancy
in case a controller fails and also helps balance the load. If multiple disks
exist on a controller, at least two of the disks on each controller should
store a replica.</p>
</li><li>
<p>If necessary, you could create state database replicas on
a slice that will be used as part of a RAID-0, RAID-1, or RAID-5 volume, .
You must create the replicas before you add the slice to the volume.  Solaris Volume Manager reserves
the beginning of the slice for the state database replica.</p>
<p>When
a state database replica is placed on a slice that becomes part of a volume,
the capacity of the volume is reduced by the space that is occupied by the
replica. The space used by a replica is rounded up to the next cylinder boundary.
This space is skipped by the volume.</p>
</li><li>
<p>RAID-1 volumes are used for small-sized random I/O (as in
for a database). For best performance, have at least two extra replicas per
RAID-1 volume on slices (and preferably on separate disks and controllers)
that are unconnected to the RAID-1 volume. </p>
</li><li>
<p>You cannot create state database replicas on existing file
systems, or the root (<code class="filename">/</code>), <code class="filename">/usr</code>,
and <code class="filename">swap</code> file systems. If necessary, you can create a
new slice (provided a slice name is available) by allocating space from <code class="filename">swap</code>. Then, put the state database replicas on that new slice. </p>
</li><li>
<p>You can create state database replicas on slices that are
not in use.</p>
</li><li>
<p>You can add additional state database replicas to the system
at any time. The additional state database replicas help ensure Solaris Volume Manager availability. </p>
<div class="caution" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Caution</h3>

<p>If you upgraded from the Solstice DiskSuite product to Solaris Volume Manager and
you have state database replicas sharing slices with file systems or logical
volumes (as opposed to on separate slices), do not delete the existing replicas
and replace them with new replicas in the same location.</p>
<p>The default
state database replica size in Solaris Volume Manager is 8192 blocks, while the default
size in the Solstice DiskSuite product is 1034 blocks. Use caution if you
delete a default-sized state database replica created in the Solstice DiskSuite
product, and then add a new default-sized replica with Solaris Volume Manager. You
will overwrite the first 7158 blocks of any file system that occupies the
rest of the shared slice, thus destroying the data. </p>
