<p>This section discusses the different types of disk sets available in Solaris Volume Manager.</p>
<div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="eqbhy"></a>Local Disk Sets</h3></div></div></div>

<p>Each host has a local disk set. The local disk set consists of all of
the disks on a host that are not in a named disk set. A local disk set belongs
exclusively to a specific host. The local disk set contains the state database
for that specific host's configuration. Volumes and hot spare pools in the
local disk set consist only of drives from within the local disk set.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="eqbia"></a>Named Disk Sets</h3></div></div></div>

<p>In addition to local disk sets, hosts can participate in named disk
sets. A named disk set is any disk set that is not in the local disk set.
You can implement the following types of named disk sets to manage volumes,
depending on the configuration of your system.</p>
<div class="sect3" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="eqbib"></a>Shared Disk Sets</h4></div></div></div>

<p>A <span class="emphasis"><em>shared disk set</em></span> can be shared by multiple hosts.
Although a shared disk set is visible from all the participating hosts, only
the owner of the disk set can access it. Each host can control a shared disk
set, but only one host can control it at a time. Additionally, shared disk
sets provide a distinct namespace within which the volume is managed.</p>
<p>A shared disk set supports data redundancy and data availability. If
one host fails, another host can take over the failed host's disk set (this
type of configuration is known as a <span class="emphasis"><em>failover configuration</em></span>).</p>
<div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Note</h3>

<p>Shared disk sets are intended, in part, for use with Sun Cluster,
Solstice HA (High Availability), or another supported third-party HA framework.
Solaris Volume Manager by itself does not provide all the functionality necessary
to implement a failover configuration.</p>
</div>
<p>Although each host can control the set of disks, only one host can control
it at a time.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect3" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="eqbhz"></a>Autotake Disk Sets</h4></div></div></div>

<p>Before the autotake feature became available in the Solaris 9 4/04 release, Solaris Volume Manager did
not support the automatic mounting of file systems on disk sets through the <code class="literal">/etc/vfstab</code> file. Solaris Volume Manager required the system administrator
to manually issue a disk set take command by using the <span><strong class="command">metaset <code class="option">
s</code> <em class="replaceable"><code>setname</code></em> <code class="option">
t</code>
</strong></span> command
before the file systems on the disk set could be accessed.</p>
<p>With the autotake feature, you can set a disk set to be automatically
accessed at boot time by using the <span><strong class="command">metaset</strong></span> <code class="option">
s</code> <em class="replaceable"><code>setname</code></em> <code class="option">
A</code> <code class="literal">enable</code> command.
The autotake feature makes it possible for you to define at boot the mount
options for a file system in the <code class="literal">/etc/vfstab</code> file. This
feature allows you to define the mount options in the <code class="literal">/etc/vfstab</code> file
for file systems on volumes in the enabled disk set.</p>
<p>Only single-host disk sets support the autotake feature. The autotake
feature requires that the disk set is not shared with any other systems. A
disk set that is shared cannot be set to use the autotake feature, and the <span><strong class="command">metaset</strong></span> <code class="option">
A</code> command will fail. However, after other
hosts are removed from the disk set, it may then be set to autotake. Similarly,
an autotake disk set cannot have other hosts added to it. If the autotake
feature is disabled, additional hosts can then be added to the disk  set. </p>
<div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Note</h3>

<p>In a Sun Cluster environment, the autotake feature is disabled.
Sun Cluster handles the take and release of a disk set.</p>
</div>
<p>For more information on the autotake feature see the <code class="option">
A</code> option
of the <span class="olink">
<span class="citerefentry">
<span class="refentrytitle">metaset</span>
(

</span>
</span> command.</p>

<div class="sect3" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="eqbid"></a>Multi-Owner Disk Sets</h4></div></div></div>

<p>Named disk sets created in a Sun Cluster environment are called multi-owner
disk sets. Multi-owner disk sets allow multiple nodes to share the ownership
of the disk sets and to simultaneously access the shared disks. All disks
and volumes in a multi-owner disk set can be directly accessed by all the
nodes in a cluster. Each multi-owner disk set contains a list of hosts that
have been added to the disk set. Consequently, each multi-owner disk set within
a cluster configuration can have a different (and sometimes overlapping) set
of hosts.</p>
<p>Each multi-owner disk set has a master node. The function of the master
node is to manage and update the state database replica changes. Since there
is a master node per disk set, multiple masters can exist simultaneously.
There are two ways that the master is chosen. The first way is that a node
becomes the master if it is the first node to add a disk to the disk set.
The second way is when a master node panics and fails. The node with the lowest
node id becomes the master node.</p>
<p>Multi-owner disk set functionality is enabled only in a Sun Cluster
environment to manage multi-owner disk set storage. The Solaris Volume Manager for Sun Cluster feature works
with releases of Sun Cluster beginning with the Sun Cluster 10/04 software
collection and with applications like Oracle Real Applications Clusters. For
more information on Solaris Volume Manager for Sun Cluster, see Chapter 4, Solaris Volume Manager for
Sun Cluster (Overview).</p>
<p>Before you can configure multi-owner disk sets, the following software
must be installed in addition to the Solaris OS:</p>
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li>
<p>Sun Cluster initial cluster framework</p>
</li><li>
<p>Sun Cluster Support for Oracle Real Application Clusters software</p>
</li><li>
<p>Oracle Real Application Clusters software</p>
</li></ul></div>
