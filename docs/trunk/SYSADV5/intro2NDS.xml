</highlights><sect1 id="a00intro-21293"><title>What Is a Naming Service?</title><para><emphasis>Naming services</emphasis> store information in a central
place, which enables users, machines, and applications to communicate across
the network. This information can include the following.</para><itemizedlist><listitem><para>Machine (host) names and addresses</para>
</listitem><listitem><para>User names</para>
</listitem><listitem><para>Passwords</para>
</listitem><listitem><para>Access permissions</para>
</listitem><listitem><para>Group membership, printers, and so on</para>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist><para>Without a central naming service, each machine would have to maintain
its own copy of this information. Naming service information can be stored
in files, maps, or database tables.  If you centralize all data, administration
becomes easier.</para><para>Naming services are fundamental to any computing network. Among other
features, naming service provide functionality that does the following.</para><itemizedlist><listitem><para>Associates (<emphasis>binds</emphasis>) names with objects</para>
</listitem><listitem><para>Resolves names to objects</para>
</listitem><listitem><para>Removes bindings</para>
</listitem><listitem><para>Lists names</para>
</listitem><listitem><para>Renames</para>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist><para>A network information service enables machines to be identified by common
names instead of numerical addresses. This makes communication simpler because
users do not have to remember and try to enter cumbersome numerical addresses
like <literal>192.168.0.0</literal>.</para><para>For example, take a network of three machines that are named, <literal>pine</literal>, <literal>elm</literal>, and <literal>oak</literal>. Before <literal>pine</literal> can send a message to either <literal>elm</literal> or <literal>oak</literal>, <literal>pine</literal> must know their numerical network addresses.
For this reason, <literal>pine</literal> keeps a file, <filename>/etc/hosts</filename> or <filename>/etc/inet/ipnodes</filename>, that stores the network address of every machine
in the network, including itself.</para><mediaobject><imageobject><imagedata entityref="fig54.epsi"/>
</imageobject><textobject><simpara>Illustration shows pine, elm, and oak machines with respective
IP addresses listed on pine.</simpara>
</textobject>
</mediaobject><para>Likewise, in order for <literal>elm</literal> and <literal>oak</literal> to
communicate with <literal>pine</literal> or with each other, the machines
must keep similar files.</para><mediaobject><imageobject><imagedata entityref="fig55.epsi"/>
</imageobject><textobject><simpara>Illustration shows machines keeping all IP addresses
of machines on network in their respective /etc/hosts file.</simpara>
</textobject>
</mediaobject><para>In addition to storing addresses, machines store security information,
mail data, network services information and so on.  As networks offer more
services, the list stored of information grows. As a result, each machine
might need to keep an entire set of files which are similar to <filename>/etc/hosts</filename> or <filename>/etc/inet/ipnodes</filename>.</para><para>A network information service stores network information on a server,
which can be queried by any machine.</para><para>The machines are known as <emphasis>clients</emphasis> of the server.
The following figure illustrates the client-server arrangement. Whenever information
about the network changes, instead of updating each client's local file, an
administrator updates only the information stored by the network information
service. Doing so reduces errors, inconsistencies between clients, and the
sheer size of the task.</para><mediaobject><imageobject><imagedata entityref="fig56.epsi"/>
</imageobject><textobject><simpara>Illustration shows server and clients in client-server
computing relationship.</simpara>
</textobject>
</mediaobject><para>This arrangement, of a server providing centralized services to clients
across a network, is known as <emphasis>client-server computing</emphasis>.</para><para>Although the main purpose of a network information service is to centralize
information, the network information service can also simplify network names.
For example, assume your company has set up a network which is connected to
the Internet. The Internet has assigned your network the network number <literal>192.168.0.0</literal> and the domain name <literal>doc.com</literal>. Your
company has two divisions, Sales and Manufacturing (Manf), so its network
is divided into a main net and one subnet for each division. Each net has
its own address.</para><mediaobject><imageobject><imagedata entityref="fig57.epsi"/>
</imageobject><textobject><simpara>Diagram shows doc.com and two subnets with IP addresses.</simpara>
</textobject>
</mediaobject><para>Each division could be identified by its network address, as shown above,
but descriptive names made possible by naming services would be preferable.</para><mediaobject><imageobject><imagedata entityref="fig58.epsi"/>
</imageobject><textobject><simpara>Diagram shows doc.com and two subnets with descriptive
names.</simpara>
</textobject>
</mediaobject><para>Instead of addressing mail or other network communications to <literal>198.168.0.0</literal>, mail could be addressed to <literal>doc</literal>. Instead of
addressing mail to <literal>192.168.2.0</literal> or <literal>192.168.3.0</literal>,
mail could be addressed to <literal>sales.doc</literal> or  <literal>manf.doc</literal>.</para><para>Names are also more flexible than physical addresses. Physical networks
tend to remain stable, but company organization tends to change.</para><para>For example, assume that the <literal>doc.com</literal> network is supported
by three servers, S1, S2, and S3. Assume that two of those servers, S1 and
S3, support clients.</para><mediaobject><imageobject><imagedata entityref="fig59.epsi"/>

S1. Clients C4, C5, and C6 would obtain information from server S3. The resulting
network is summarized in the following table. The table is a generalized representation

some resources from the other two divisions, but did not create a third subnet.

DNS was developed so that machines on the network could be identified with
common names instead of Internet addresses. DNS performs naming between hosts
within your local administrative domain and across domain boundaries.</para><para>The collection of networked machines that use DNS are referred
to as the <emphasis>DNS namespace</emphasis>. The DNS namespace can be divided
into a hierarchy of <emphasis>domains</emphasis>. A DNS domain is a group
of machines. Each domain is supported by two or more <emphasis>name servers</emphasis>,
a principal server and one or more secondary servers. Each server implements
DNS by running the <command>in.named</command> daemon. On the client's side,
DNS is implemented through the &#8220;resolver.&#8221; The resolver's function
is to resolve users' queries. The resolver queries a name server, which then
returns either the requested information or a referral to another server.</para>

Naming Service</title><para>The original host-based UNIX naming system was developed for standalone
UNIX machines and then adapted for network use. Many old UNIX operating systems
and machines still use this system, but the system is not well suited for
large complex networks.</para>
</sect2><sect2 id="a00intro-97078"><title>Description of the NIS Naming Service</title><para>The <emphasis>Network Information Service</emphasis> (NIS) was developed
independently of DNS. DNS makes communication simpler by using machine names
instead of numerical IP addresses. NIS focuses on making network administration
more manageable by providing centralized control over a variety of network
information. NIS stores information about the network,  machine names and
addresses, users, and network services. This collection of network information
is referred to as the <emphasis>NIS namespace</emphasis>.</para><para>NIS namespace information is stored in NIS maps. NIS maps were designed
to replace UNIX <filename>/etc</filename> files, as well as other configuration
files. NIS maps store much more than names and addresses. As a result, the
NIS namespace has a large set of maps. See <olink targetptr="anis2-11278" remap="internal">Working
With NIS Maps</olink> for more information.</para><para>NIS uses a client-server arrangement which is similar to DNS. Replicated
NIS servers provide services to NIS clients. The principal servers are called <emphasis>master</emphasis> servers, and for reliability, the servers have backup, or <emphasis>slave</emphasis> servers. Both master and slave servers use the NIS  retrieval
software and both store NIS maps. For more information on NIS Architecture
and NIS Administration, see <olink targetptr="cnis1-25208" remap="internal">Chapter&#160;5,
Setting Up and Configuring NIS Service</olink> and <olink targetptr="anis2-22217" remap="internal">Chapter&#160;6, Administering NIS (Tasks)</olink>.</para>
</sect2><sect2 id="a00intro-34260"><title>Description of the NIS+ Naming Service</title><para>The <emphasis>Network Information Service Plus</emphasis> (NIS+) is
similar to NIS but with more features. However, NIS+ is not an extension of
NIS.</para><para>The NIS+ naming service is designed to conform to the shape of the organization.
Unlike NIS, the NIS+ namespace is dynamic because updates can occur and be
put into effect at any time by any authorized user.</para><para>NIS+ enables you to store information about machine addresses, security
information, mail information, Ethernet interfaces, and network services in
one central location. This configuration of network information is referred
to as the NIS+ <emphasis>namespace</emphasis>.</para><para>The NIS+ namespace is hierarchical. The NIS+ namespace is similar in
structure to the UNIX directory file system. The hierarchical structure allows
an NIS+ namespace to be configured to conform to the logical hierarchy of
an organization. The namespace's layout of information is unrelated to its <emphasis>physical</emphasis> arrangement. Thus, an NIS+ namespace can be divided into
multiple domains that can be administered autonomously. Clients might have
access to information in domains other than their own if the clients have
the appropriate permissions.</para><para>NIS+ uses a client-server model to store and have access to the information
contained in an NIS+ namespace. Each domain is supported by a set of servers.
The principal server is called the <emphasis>primary</emphasis> server. The
backup servers are called <emphasis>secondary servers</emphasis>. The network
information is stored in 16 standard NIS+ tables in an internal NIS+ database.
Both primary and secondary servers run NIS+ server software and both maintain
copies of NIS+ tables. Changes made to the NIS+ data on the master server
are incrementally propagated automatically to the secondary servers.</para><para>NIS+ includes a sophisticated security system to protect the structure
of the namespace and its information. NIS+ uses authentication and authorization
to verify whether a client's request for information should be fulfilled. <emphasis>Authentication</emphasis> determines whether the information requester is
a valid user on the network. <emphasis>Authorization</emphasis> determines
whether a particular user is allowed to have or modify the information requested.
