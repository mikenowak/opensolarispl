<chapter id="pppsvrconfig.intro-1"><title>Solaris PPP 4.0 (Overview)</title><highlights><para>This section covers serial networking
topics. Serial networking refers to
the use of a serial interface, such
as an RS-232 or V.35 port, to connect
two or more computers for data transfer.
Unlike LAN interfaces, such as Ethernet,
these serial interfaces are used to
connect systems that are separated
by large distances. PPP (Point-to-Point
Protocol) and UUCP (UNIX-to-UNIX CoPy)
are distinct technologies that can
be used to implement serial networking.
When a serial interface is configured
for networking, it is made available
for multiple users, in much the same
way as any other network interface,
such as Ethernet.</para><para>This chapter introduces Solaris
PPP 4.0. This version of PPP enables
two computers in different physical
locations to communicate with each
other by using PPP over a variety
of media. Starting with the Solaris
9 release, Solaris PPP 4.0 is included
as part of the base installation.</para><itemizedlist><para>The following topics are discussed:</para><listitem><para><olink targetptr="pppsvrconfig.intro-30" remap="internal">Solaris

the Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP),
a data link protocol, which is a member
of the TCP/IP protocol suite. PPP
describes how data is transmitted
between two endpoint machines, over
communications media such as telephone
lines.</para><para>Since the early 1990s, PPP has
been a widely used Internet standard
for sending datagrams over a communications
link. The PPP standard is described
in RFC 1661 by the Point-to-Point
Working Group of the Internet Engineering
Task Force (IETF). PPP is commonly
used when remote  computers call an
Internet service provider (ISP) or
a corporate server that is configured
to receive incoming calls.</para><para>Solaris PPP 4.0 is based on

a PPP link is optional. Moreover,

for DSL Users Through PPPoE</title><para>Many network providers
and individuals who are working at
home use Digital Subscriber Line (DSL)
technology to provide fast network
access. To support DSL users, Solaris
PPP 4.0 includes the PPP over Ethernet
(PPPoE) feature. PPPoE technology
enables multiple hosts to run PPP
sessions over one Ethernet link to
one or more destinations.</para><itemizedlist><para>If one of the following factors

</itemizedlist><para>This section introduces terms

Overview</title><para><emphasis>PPPoE</emphasis> is
a proprietary protocol from RedBack
Networks. PPPoE is a discovery protocol,
rather than another version of standard
PPP. In a PPPoE scenario, a machine
that initiates PPP communications
first must locate, or <emphasis>discover</emphasis>,
a peer that runs PPPoE. The PPPoE
protocol uses Ethernet broadcast packets
to locate the peer. </para><para>After the discovery process,
PPPoE sets up an Ethernet-based tunnel
from the initiating host, or <emphasis>PPPoE
client</emphasis>, to the peer, the <emphasis>PPPoE access server</emphasis>. <emphasis>Tunneling</emphasis> is the practice
of running one protocol on top of
another protocol.  Using PPPoE, Solaris
PPP 4.0 tunnels PPP over Ethernet
IEEE 802.2, both of which are data
link protocols. The resulting PPP
connection behaves like a dedicated
link between the PPPoE client and
the access server. For detailed information
about PPPoE, see <olink targetptr="ppp.reference-45" remap="internal">Creating
PPPoE Tunnels for DSL Support</olink>.</para>

Consumers</title><para>As system administrator, you
might assist consumers with their
PPPoE configurations. One common type
of PPPoE consumer is an individual
who needs to run PPPoE over a DSL
line. Another PPPoE consumer is a
company that purchases a DSL line
through which employees can run PPPoE
tunnels, as illustrated in the previous
figure. </para><para>The main reason for a corporate
consumer to use PPPoE is to offer
PPP communications through a high-speed
DSL device to a number of hosts. Often,
 a single PPPoE client has an individual <emphasis>DSL modem</emphasis>. Or, a group
of clients on a hub might share a
DSL modem that is also connected to
the hub by an Ethernet line.</para><note><para>DSL devices are technically
bridges, not modems. However, because
common practice is to refer to these
devices as modems, this guide uses
the term &#8220;DSL modem.&#8221;</para>

at a Telephone Company</title><para>The telephone company
is the middle layer of the PPPoE scenario.
The telephone company splits the signal
that is received over the phone line
by using a device that is called a <emphasis>Digital Subscriber Line Access Multiplexer
(DSLAM)</emphasis>. The DSLAM breaks
out the signals onto separate wires,
analog wires for telephone service,
and digital wires for PPPoE. From
the DSLAM, the digital wires extend
the tunnel over an ATM data network
to the ISP.</para>
</sect3><sect3 id="ppp.intro-24"><title>PPPoE
at a Service Provider</title><para>The ISP receives the PPPoE transmission
from the ATM data network over a bridge.
At the ISP, an access server that
runs PPPoE functions as the peer for
the PPP link. The access server is
very similar in function to the dial-in
server that was introduced in <olink targetptr="pppsvrconfig.intro-fig-3" remap="internal">Figure
15&#8211;2</olink>, but the access
server does not use modems. The access
server converts the individual PPPoE
sessions into regular IP traffic,
for example Internet access.</para><para>If you are a system administrator
