<p>If a device cannot be opened, it displays as <code class="literal">UNAVAILABLE</code> in
the <span><strong class="command">zpool status</strong></span> output. This status means that ZFS was
unable to open the device when the pool was first accessed, or the device
has since become unavailable. If the device causes a top-level virtual device
to be unavailable, then nothing in the pool can be accessed. Otherwise, the
fault tolerance of the pool might be compromised. In either case, the device
simply needs to be reattached to the system to restore normal operation.<a class="indexterm" name="indexterm-534"></a>

</p>
<p>For example, you might see a message similar to the following from <span><strong class="command">fmd</strong></span> after a device failure:</p>
<pre class="screen">SUNW-MSG-ID: ZFS-8000-D3, TYPE: Fault, VER: 1, SEVERITY: Major
EVENT-TIME: Fri Mar 17 14:38:47 MST 2006
PLATFORM: SUNW,Ultra-60, CSN: -, HOSTNAME: neo
SOURCE: zfs-diagnosis, REV: 1.0
EVENT-ID: 043bb0dd-f0a5-4b8f-a52d-8809e2ce2e0a
DESC: A ZFS device failed.  Refer to http://sun.com/msg/ZFS-8000-D3 for more information.
AUTO-RESPONSE: No automated response will occur.
IMPACT: Fault tolerance of the pool may be compromised.
REC-ACTION: Run 'zpool status -x' and replace the bad device.</pre>
<p>The next step is to use the <span><strong class="command">zpool status</strong></span> <code class="option">
x</code> command
to view more detailed information about the device problem and the resolution.
For example:</p>
<pre class="screen"># <strong class="userinput"><code>zpool status -x</code></strong>
  pool: tank
 state: DEGRADED
status: One or more devices could not be opened.  Sufficient replicas exist for
        the pool to continue functioning in a degraded state.
action: Attach the missing device and online it using 'zpool online'.

<p>You can see from this output that the missing device <code class="literal">c0t1d0</code> is
not functioning. If you determine that the drive is faulty, replace the device.</p>
<p>Then, use the <span><strong class="command">zpool online</strong></span> command to online the
replaced device. For example:</p>
<pre class="screen"># <strong class="userinput"><code>zpool online tank c0t1d0</code></strong>
</pre>
<p>Confirm that the pool with the replaced device is healthy.</p>
<pre class="screen"># <strong class="userinput"><code>zpool status -x tank</code></strong>
pool 'tank' is healthy</pre>
<div class="sect2" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="gbbxn"></a>Physically Reattaching the Device</h3></div></div></div>

<p>Exactly how a missing device is reattached depends on the device in
question. If the device is a network-attached drive, connectivity should be
restored. If the device is a USB or other removable media, it should be reattached
to the system. If the device is a local disk, a controller might have failed
such that the device is no longer visible to the system. In this case, the
controller should be replaced at which point the disks will again be available.
Other pathologies can exist and depend on the type of hardware and its configuration.
If a drive fails and it is no longer visible to the system (an unlikely event),
the device should be treated as a damaged device. Follow the procedures outlined
in <span class="olink">Repairing a Damaged Device</span>.</p>

<p>Once a device is reattached to the system, ZFS might or might not automatically
detect its availability. If the pool was previously faulted, or the system
was rebooted as part of the attach procedure, then ZFS automatically rescans
all devices when it tries to open the pool. If the pool was degraded and the
device was replaced while the system was up, you must notify ZFS that the
device is now available and ready to be reopened by using the <span><strong class="command">zpool
online</strong></span> command. For example:<a class="indexterm" name="indexterm-537"></a>
<a class="indexterm" name="indexterm-538"></a>
<a class="indexterm" name="indexterm-539"></a>
</p>
<pre class="screen"># <strong class="userinput"><code>zpool online tank c0t1d0</code></strong>
</pre>
