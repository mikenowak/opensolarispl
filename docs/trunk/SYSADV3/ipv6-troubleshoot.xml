</highlights><sect1 id="ipconfig-138"><title>General Network Troubleshooting Tips</title><para>One of the first signs of trouble on a network is a loss of communications
by one or more hosts. If a host does not to come up at all the first time
that the host is added to the network, the problem might be in one of the
configuration files. The problem might also be a faulty network interface
card. If a single host suddenly develops a problem, the network interface
might be the cause. If the hosts on a network can communicate with each other
but not with other networks, the problem could lie with the router. Or, the
problem could be in another network. </para><para>You can use the <command>ifconfig</command> command to obtain
information on network interfaces. Use the <command>netstat</command> command
to display routing tables and protocol statistics. Third-party network diagnostic
programs provide a number of troubleshooting tools. Refer to third-party documentation
for information. </para><para>Less obvious are the causes of problems that degrade performance
on the network. For example, you can use tools such as <command>ping</command> to
quantify problems such as the loss of packets by a host. </para><sect2 id="ipconfig-139"><title>Running Basic Diagnostic Checks</title><para>If the network has problems, you can run a series of software

these routers do not check the data that is contained within the packets.</para>
</listitem><listitem><para>Address spoofing is a major issue on tunnels to a 6to4 relay
router. For incoming traffic, the 6to4 router is unable to match the IPv4
address of the relay router with the IPv6 address of the source. Therefore,
the address of the IPv6 host can easily be spoofed. The address of the 6to4
relay router can also be spoofed.</para>
</listitem><listitem><para>By default, no trust mechanism exists between 6to4 routers
and 6to4 relay routers. Thus, a 6to4 router cannot identify whether the 6to4
relay router is to be trusted, or even if it is a legitimate 6to4 relay router.
A trust relationship between the 6to4 site and the IPv6 destination must exist,
