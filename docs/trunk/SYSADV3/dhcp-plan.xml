A DHCP server's client capacity depends greatly on the number of transactions
per second that the server must process. Lease times and usage patterns have
a significant impact on the transaction rate. For example, suppose leases
are set to 12 hours and users turn their systems off at night. If many users
turn on their systems at the same time in the morning, the server must handle
transaction peaks as many clients request leases simultaneously. The DHCP
server can support fewer clients in such an environment. The DHCP server can
support more clients in an environment with longer leases, or an environment
that consists of constantly connected devices such as cable modems.</para><para>The section <olink targetptr="chapter2-39" remap="internal">Choosing the DHCP Data Store</olink> compares

</sect2><sect2 id="chapter2-40"><title>Setting a Lease Policy</title><para>A <emphasis>lease</emphasis> specifies the amount of time the
DHCP server permits a DHCP client to use a particular IP address. During the
initial server configuration, you must specify a site-wide lease policy. The <emphasis>lease policy</emphasis> indicates the lease time and specifies whether clients
can renew their leases. The server uses the information that you supply to
set option values in the default macros that the server creates during configuration.
You can set different lease policies for specific clients or type of clients,
by setting options in configuration macros you create.</para><para>The <emphasis>lease time</emphasis> is specified as a number of
hours, days, or weeks for which the lease is valid. When a client is assigned
an IP address, or renegotiates a lease on an IP address, the lease expiration
date and time is calculated. The number of hours in the lease time is added
to the timestamp on the client's DHCP acknowledgement. For example, suppose
the timestamp of the DHCP acknowledgment is September 16, 2005 9:15 A.M.,
and the lease time is 24 hours. The lease expiration time in this example
is September 17, 2005 9:15 A.M. The lease expiration time is stored in the
client's DHCP network record, viewable in DHCP Manager or with the <command>pntadm</command>utility.</para><para>The lease time value should be relatively small so that expired addresses
are reclaimed quickly. The lease time value also should be large enough to
outlast DHCP service disruptions. Clients should be able to function while
the system that runs the DHCP service is repaired. A general guideline is
to specify a time that is two times the predicted downtime of a system. For
example, if you need four hours to obtain and replace a defective part and
reboot the system, specify a lease time of eight hours.</para><para>The lease negotiation option determines whether a client can renegotiate
its lease with the server before the lease expires. If lease negotiation is
allowed, the client tracks the time that remains in its lease. When half of
the lease time has passed, the client requests the DHCP server to extend its
lease to the original lease time. You should disable lease negotiation in
environments where there are more systems than IP addresses. The time limit
is then enforced on the use of IP addresses. If there are enough IP addresses,
you should enable lease negotiation to avoid forcing clients to take down
their network interfaces when leases expire. If you make clients obtain new
leases, the clients' TCP connections such as NFS and telnet sessions might
be interrupted. You can enable lease negotiation for all clients during the
server configuration. You can enable lease negotiation for particular clients
or particular types of clients through the use of the <literal>LeaseNeg</literal> option
in configuration macros.</para><note><para>Systems that provide services on the network should retain their
IP addresses. Such systems should not be subject to short-term leases. You
can use DHCP with such systems if you assign reserved manual IP addresses
to those systems, rather than IP addresses with permanent leases. You can
then detect when the system's IP address is no longer in use.</para>

that you select is mapped to the IP addresses. By default, the server macro
is selected because the macro contains information needed by all clients that
use this server.</para>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist><para>Clients receive the options contained in the network address macro before
the options in the macro that is mapped to IP addresses. This processing order
causes the options in the server macro to take precedence over any conflicting

macros are processed.</para>
</sect2><sect2 id="chapter2-22"><title>Dynamic and Permanent Lease Types</title><para>The <emphasis>lease type</emphasis> determines whether the lease
policy applies to the IP addresses you are configuring. During initial server
configuration, DHCP Manager allows you to select either dynamic or permanent
leases for the addresses you are adding. If you configure the DHCP server
with the <literal>dhcpconfig</literal> command, leases are dynamic.</para><para>When an IP address has a <emphasis>dynamic lease</emphasis>, the DHCP
server can manage the address. The DHCP server can allocate the IP address
to a client, extend the lease time, detect when the address is no longer in
use, and reclaim the address. When an IP address has a <emphasis>permanent
lease</emphasis>, the DHCP server can only allocate the address. The client
then owns the address until explicitly releasing the address. When the address
is released, the server can assign the address to another client. The address
is not subject to the lease policy as long as the address is configured with
a permanent lease type.</para><para>When you configure a range of IP addresses, the lease type you select
applies to all the addresses in the range. To get the most benefit from DHCP,
you should use dynamic leases for most of the addresses. You can later modify
individual addresses to make them permanent, if necessary. However, the total
number of permanent leases should be kept to a minimum.</para>
</sect2><sect2 id="dhcp-plan-4"><title>Reserved IP Addresses and Lease Type</title><itemizedlist><para>IP addresses can be reserved by manually assigning them to particular
clients. A reserved address can be associated with a permanent lease or a
dynamic lease. When a reserved address is assigned a permanent lease, the

to the address.</para>

</itemizedlist><para>If a reserved address is assigned a dynamic lease, the address can be
allocated only to the client that is bound to the address. However, the client
must track lease time and negotiate for a lease extension as if the address
were not reserved. This strategy enables you to track when the client is using
the address by looking at the network table.</para><para>You cannot create reserved addresses for all the IP addresses during

to the client after the client has attempted to contact the primary server
for 20 seconds. If a client requests a specific IP address, and the server
that owns the address is not available, one of the other servers handles the
request. In this case, the client does not receive the requested address.

that prompt you for the essential information required to configure a server:
data store format, lease policy, DNS/NIS/NIS+ servers and domains, and router
addresses. Some of the information is obtained by the wizard from system files,
