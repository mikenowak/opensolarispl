<p>The IANA has reserved three blocks of IPv4 addresses for companies to
use on their private networks. These addresses are defined in <A  HREF="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1918.txt?number=1918">RFC
1918, Address Allocation for Private Internets</A>. You can use these <b>private addresses</b>, also known as 1918 addresses, for systems on
local networks within a corporate intranet. However, private addresses are
not valid on the Internet. Do not use them on systems that must communicate
outside the local network.</p>

</table><A NAME="ipplan-25"></A><h3>How IP Addresses Apply to Network Interfaces</h3>
<p><A NAME="indexterm-247"></A><A NAME="indexterm-248"></A>To connect to the network, a system must have at least one <b>physical network interface</b>. Each network interface must have its
own unique IP address. During Solaris installation, you must supply the IP
address for the first interface that the installation program finds. Usually
that interface has the name <i>device-name</i>0, for example <tt>eri0</tt> or <tt>hme0</tt>. This interface is considered the <b>primary network interface</b>.</p>
<p>If you add a second network interface to a host, that interface also
must have its own unique IP address. When you add the second network interface,
the host then becomes <b>multihomed</b>. By contrast, when you
add a second network interface to a host and enable IP forwarding, that host
becomes a router. See <A HREF="p20.html#ipconfig-116">Configuring an IPv4 Router</A> for an explanation. </p>
<p>Each network interface has a device name, a device driver, and an associated
device file in the <tt>/devices</tt> directory. The network interface
might have a device name such as <tt>eri</tt> or <tt>smc0</tt>,
which are device names for two commonly used Ethernet interfaces. </p>
<p>For information and tasks related to interfaces, refer to  <A HREF="p25.html#fwawf">Chapter&nbsp;6, Administering Network Interfaces (Tasks)</A>.</p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade><p><b>Note - </b><A NAME="indexterm-249"></A><A NAME="indexterm-250"></A><A NAME="indexterm-251"></A>This book assumes that your systems have Ethernet network interfaces.
If you plan to use different network media, refer to the manuals that come
with the network interface for configuration information. </p>
<hr size="1" noshade></p><A NAME="ipplan-26"></A><h2>Naming Entities on Your Network</h2>
<p><A NAME="indexterm-252"></A><A NAME="indexterm-253"></A>After you receive your assigned network IP address and you have
given the IP addresses to your systems, the next task is to assign names to
the hosts. Then you must determine how to handle name services on your network.
You use these names initially when you set up your network and later when
you expand your network through routers, bridges, or PPP. </p>
<p>The TCP/IP protocols locate a system on a network by using its IP address.
However, if you use a recognizable name, then you can easily identify the
system. Therefore, the TCP/IP protocols (and the Solaris OS) require both
the IP address and the host name to uniquely identify a system. </p>
<p>From a TCP/IP perspective, a network is a set of named entities. A host
is an entity with a name. A router is an entity with a name. The network is
an entity with a name. A group or department in which the network is installed
can also be given a name, as can a division, a region, or a company. In theory,
the hierarchy of names that can be used to identify a network has virtually
no limit. The domain name identifies a <b>domain</b>.</p>
<A NAME="ipplan-27"></A><h3>Administering Host Names</h3>
<p><A NAME="indexterm-254"></A><A NAME="indexterm-255"></A><A NAME="indexterm-256"></A><A NAME="indexterm-257"></A>Many sites let users pick host names for their machines. Servers
also require at least one host name, which is associated with the IP address
of its primary network interface. </p>
<p>As a system administrator, you must ensure that each host name in your
domain is unique. In other words, no two machines on your network can both
have the name "fred." However, the machine "fred"
might have multiple IP addresses. </p>
<p>When planning your network, make a list of IP addresses and their associated
host names for easy access during the setup process. The list can help you
verify that all host names are unique.</p>
<A NAME="ipplan-28"></A><h3>Selecting a Name Service and Directory Service</h3>
<p><A NAME="indexterm-258"></A><A NAME="indexterm-259"></A>The Solaris OS enables you to use three types of name services:
local files, NIS, and DNS. Name services maintain critical information about
the machines on a network, such as the host names, IP addresses, Ethernet
addresses, and so forth. The Solaris OS also gives you the option of using
the LDAP directory service in addition to or instead of a name service. For
an introduction to name services on Solaris, refer to Part&nbsp;I, "About Naming and Directory Services," in <i>System Administration Guide: Naming and Directory Services (DNS, NIS, and LDAP)</i>.</p>
<A NAME="ipplan-29"></A><h4>Network Databases</h4>
<p><A NAME="indexterm-260"></A><A NAME="indexterm-261"></A><A NAME="indexterm-262"></A>When you install the operating system, you supply the host name
and IP address of your server, clients, or standalone system as part of the
procedure. The Solaris installation program adds this information into the <tt>hosts</tt> . This database is part of a set of network
databases that contain information necessary for TCP/IP operation on your
network. The name service that you select for your network reads these databases. </p>
<p>The configuration of the network databases is critical. Therefore, you
need to decide which name service to use as part of the network planning process.
Moreover, the decision to use name services also affects whether you organize
your network into an administrative domain. <A HREF="p52.html#ipconfig-42">Network Databases and the <tt>nsswitch.conf</tt> File</A> has detailed information on the
set of network databases.</p>
<A NAME="ipplan-30"></A><h4>Using NIS or DNS as the Name Service</h4>
<p><A NAME="indexterm-263"></A><A NAME="indexterm-264"></A><A NAME="indexterm-265"></A><A NAME="indexterm-266"></A><A NAME="indexterm-267"></A><A NAME="indexterm-268"></A>The NIS and DNS name services maintain network databases on several
servers on the network.  <i>System Administration Guide: Naming and Directory Services (DNS, NIS, and LDAP)</i> describes
these name services and explains how to configure the databases. In addition,
the guide explain the "namespace" and "administrative domain"
concepts in detail. </p>
<A NAME="ipplan-31"></A><h4>Using Local Files as the Name Service</h4>
<p><A NAME="indexterm-269"></A><A NAME="indexterm-270"></A>If you do not implement NIS, LDAP, or DNS, the network uses <b>local files</b> to provide the name service. The term "local
files" refers to the series of files in the <tt>/etc</tt> directory
that the network databases use. The procedures in this book assume you are
using local files for your name service, unless otherwise indicated. </p>
<p><hr size="1" noshade><p><b>Note - </b>If you decide to use local files as the name service for your
network, you can set up another name service at a later date.</p>
<hr size="1" noshade></p><A NAME="ipplan-32"></A><h4>Domain Names</h4>
<p><A NAME="indexterm-271"></A><A NAME="indexterm-272"></A><A NAME="indexterm-273"></A>Many networks organize their hosts and routers into a hierarchy
of administrative domains. If you are using the NIS or DNS name service, you
must select a domain name for your organization that is unique worldwide.
To ensure that your domain name is unique, you should register the domain
name with the InterNIC. If you plan to use DNS, you also need to register
your domain name with the InterNIC. </p>
<p>The domain name structure is hierarchical. A new domain typically is
located below an existing, related domain. For example, the domain name for
a subsidiary company can be located below the domain of the parent company.
If the domain name has no other relationship, an organization can place its
domain name directly under one of the existing top-level domains. </p>
<p><A NAME="indexterm-274"></A><A NAME="indexterm-275"></A>The following are a few examples of top-level domains: </p>
<ul><li><p><tt>.com</tt> - Commercial companies (international
in scope)</p>
</li>
<li><p><tt>.edu</tt> - Educational institutions
(international in scope)</p>
</li>
<li><p><tt>.gov</tt> - U.S. government agencies</p>
</li>
<li><p><tt>.fr</tt> - France</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>You select the name that identifies your organization, with the provision
that the name must be unique. </p>
<A NAME="ipplan-33"></A><h4>Administrative Subdivisions</h4>
<p><A NAME="indexterm-276"></A><A NAME="indexterm-277"></A><A NAME="indexterm-278"></A>The question of administrative subdivisions deals with matters
of size and control. The more hosts and servers that you have in a network,
the more complex your management task. You might want to handle such situations
by setting up additional administrative divisions. Add networks of a particular
class. Divide existing networks into subnets. The decision about setting up
administrative subdivisions for your network is determined by the following
factors: </p>
<ul><li><p><b>How large is the network?</b></p>
<p>A single administrative division can handle a single network of several
hundred hosts, all in the same physical location and requiring the same administrative
services. However, sometimes you should establish several administrative subdivisions.
Subdivisions are particularly useful if you have a small network with subnets
and the network is scattered over an extensive geographical area.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul><li><p><b>Do users on the network have similar
needs?</b></p>
<p><A NAME="indexterm-279"></A><A NAME="indexterm-280"></A><A NAME="indexterm-281"></A>For example, you might have a network that is confined to a single
building and supports a relatively small number of machines. These machines
are divided among a number of subnetworks. Each subnetwork supports groups
of users with different needs. In this example, you might use an administrative
subdivision for each subnet.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<A NAME="ipplan-37"></A><h2>Planning for Routers
on Your Network</h2>
<p><A NAME="indexterm-282"></A><A NAME="indexterm-283"></A>Recall that in TCP/IP, two types of entities exist on a network:
hosts and routers. All networks must have hosts, while not all networks require
routers. The physical topology of the network determines if you need routers.
This section introduces the concepts of network topology and routing. These
concepts are important when you decide to add another network to your existing
network environment. </p>
<A NAME="ipplan-38"></A><h3>Network Topology Overview</h3>
<p><A NAME="indexterm-284"></A><A NAME="indexterm-285"></A><A NAME="indexterm-286"></A><A NAME="indexterm-287"></A>Network topology describes how networks fit together. Routers
are the entities that connect networks to each other. A router is any machine
that has two or more network interfaces and implements IP forwarding. However,
the system cannot function as a router until properly configured, as described
in <A HREF="p20.html#ipconfig-116">Configuring an IPv4 Router</A>. </p>
<p><A NAME="indexterm-288"></A>Routers connect two or more networks to form larger internetworks.
The routers must be configured to pass packets between two adjacent networks.
The routers also should be able to pass packets to networks that lie beyond
the adjacent networks. </p>
<p>The following figure shows the basic parts of a network topology. The
first illustration shows a simple configuration of two networks that are connected
by a single router. The second illustration shows a configuration of three
networks, interconnected by two routers. In the first example, Router R joins
Network 1 and Network 2 into a larger internetwork. In the second example,
Router R1 connects Networks 1 and 2. Router R2 connects Networks 2 and 3.
The connections form a network that includes Networks 1, 2, and 3.</p>
<A NAME="ipplan-fig-39"></A><p><b>Figure 2-3 </b>Basic Network Topology</p>
<IMG src="figures/ipplan.fig133.gif" class="figure" alt="Diagram shows the topology of two networks that are connected
by a single router." title="Diagram shows the topology of two networks that are connected
by a single router."><p>In addition to joining networks into internetworks, routers route packets
between networks that are based on the addresses of the destination network.
As internetworks grow more complex, each router must make more and more decisions
about the packet destinations. </p>
<p><A NAME="indexterm-289"></A><A NAME="indexterm-290"></A><A NAME="indexterm-291"></A><A NAME="indexterm-292"></A><A NAME="indexterm-293"></A>The following figure shows a more complex case. Router R3 directly
connects networks 1 and 3. The redundancy improves reliability. If network
2 goes down, router R3 still provides a route between networks 1 and 3. You
can interconnect many networks. However, the networks must use the same network
protocols. </p>

Path Between Networks</p>
