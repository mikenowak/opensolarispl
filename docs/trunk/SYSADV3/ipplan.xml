of available IP addresses. To remedy this situation, the Internet Engineering
Task Force (IETF) has developed a number of IP addressing alternatives. Types
of IP addresses in use today include the following:</para><para>If your organization has been assigned more than one IP address
for your network or uses subnets, appoint a centralized authority within your
organization to assign network IP addresses. That authority should maintain
control of a pool of assigned network IP addresses, and assign network, subnet,
and host addresses as required. To prevent problems, ensure that duplicate
or random network numbers do not exist in your organization. </para><sect2 id="eyhxx"><title>IPv4 Addresses</title><para>These 32-bit addresses are the original IP addressing format that was
designed for TCP/IP. Originally, IP networks have three classes, A, B, and
C. The <emphasis>network number</emphasis> that is assigned to a network reflects
this class designation plus 8 or more bits to represent a host. Class-based
IPv4 addresses require you to configure a netmask for the network number.
Furthermore, to make more addresses available for systems on the local network,
these addresses were often divided into subnets. </para><para>Today, IP addresses are referred to as <emphasis>IPv4 addresses</emphasis>.
Although you can no longer obtain class-based IPv4 network numbers from an
ISP, many existing networks still have them. For more information about administering
IPv4 addresses, refer to <olink targetptr="exlxp" remap="internal">Designing Your IPv4 Addressing
Scheme</olink>.</para>
</sect2><sect2 id="eyhxz"><title>IPv4 Addresses in CIDR Format</title><para>The IETF has developed Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) addresses
as a short to medium term fix for the shortage of IPv4 addresses. In addition,
CIDR format was designed as a remedy to the lack of capacity of the global
Internet routing tables. An IPv4 address with CIDR notation is 32 bits in
length and has the same dotted decimal format. However, CIDR adds a prefix
designation after the rightmost byte to define the network portion of the
IPv4 address. For more information, refer to <olink targetptr="exlvx" remap="internal">Designing
Your CIDR IPv4 Addressing Scheme</olink>.</para>
</sect2><sect2 id="eyhyc"><title>DHCP Addresses</title><para>The Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) protocol enables a system
to receive configuration information from a DHCP server, including an IP address,
as part of the booting process. DHCP servers maintain pools of IP address
from  which to assign addresses to DHCP clients. A site that uses DHCP can
use a smaller pool of IP addresses than would be needed if all clients were
assigned a permanent IP address. You can set up the Solaris DHCP  service
to manage your site's IP addresses, or a portion of the addresses. For more
information, refer to <olink targetptr="dhcp-overview-1" remap="internal">Chapter&#160;12, About Solaris DHCP (Overview)</olink>.</para>
</sect2><sect2 id="eyhyd"><title>IPv6 Addresses</title><para>The IETF has deployed 128&#8211;bit IPv6 addresses as the long term
solution to the shortage of available IPv4 addresses. IPv6 addresses provide
greater address space than is available with IPv4. The Solaris OS supports
IPv4 and IPv6 addressing on the same host, through the use of dual-stack TCP/IP.
As with IPv4 addresses in CIDR format, IPv6 addresses have no notion of network
classes or netmasks. As in CIDR, IPv6 addresses use prefixes to designate
the portion of the address that defines the site's network. For an introduction
to IPv6, refer to <olink targetptr="ipv6-overview-10" remap="internal">IPv6 Addressing Overview</olink>.</para>
</sect2><sect2 id="eyhyb"><title>Private Addresses and Documentation Prefixes</title><para>The IANA has reserved a block of IPv4 addresses and an IPv6 site prefix
for use on private networks. You can deploy these addresses on systems within
an enterprise network but be aware that packets with private addresses cannot
be routed across the Internet. For more information on private addresses,
refer to <olink targetptr="ewpop" remap="internal">Using Private IPv4 Addresses</olink>.</para><note><para>Private IPv4 addresses are also reserved for documentation purposes.

</sect2><sect2 id="extaq"><title>IPv4 Subnet Number</title><para>Local networks with large numbers of hosts are sometimes divided
into subnets. If you divide your IPv4 network number into subnets, you need
to assign a network identifier to each subnet. You can maximize the efficiency
of the IPv4 address space by using some of the bits from the host part of
the IPv4 address as a network identifier. When used as a network identifier,
the specified part of the address becomes the subnet number. You create a
subnet number by using a netmask, which is a bitmask that selects the network
and subnet parts of an IPv4 address. Refer to <olink targetptr="ipconfig-32" remap="internal">Creating
the Network Mask for IPv4 Addresses</olink> for details. </para>

</sect2><sect2 id="ipplan-25"><title>How IP Addresses Apply to Network Interfaces</title><para>To connect to the network, a system must have at least one <emphasis>physical network interface</emphasis>. Each network interface must have its
own unique IP address. During Solaris installation, you must supply the IP
address for the first interface that the installation program finds. Usually
that interface has the name <replaceable>device-name</replaceable>0, for example <literal>eri0</literal> or <literal>hme0</literal>. This interface is considered the <emphasis>primary network interface</emphasis>.</para><para>If you add a second network interface to a host, that interface also
must have its own unique IP address. When you add the second network interface,
the host then becomes <emphasis>multihomed</emphasis>. By contrast, when you
add a second network interface to a host and enable IP forwarding, that host
becomes a router. See <olink targetptr="ipconfig-116" remap="internal">Configuring an IPv4
Router</olink> for an explanation. </para><para>Each network interface has a device name, a device driver, and an associated
device file in the <filename>/devices</filename> directory. The network interface
might have a device name such as <filename>eri</filename> or <filename>smc0</filename>,
which are device names for two commonly used Ethernet interfaces. </para><para>For information and tasks related to interfaces, refer to  <olink targetptr="fwawf" remap="internal">Chapter&#160;6, Administering
Network Interfaces (Tasks)</olink>.</para><note><para>This book assumes that your systems have Ethernet network interfaces.
If you plan to use different network media, refer to the manuals that come
with the network interface for configuration information. </para>

</sect1><sect1 id="ipplan-26"><title>Naming Entities on Your Network</title><para>After you receive your assigned network IP address and you have
given the IP addresses to your systems, the next task is to assign names to
the hosts. Then you must determine how to handle name services on your network.
You use these names initially when you set up your network and later when
you expand your network through routers, bridges, or PPP. </para><para>The TCP/IP protocols locate a system on a network by using its IP address.
However, if you use a recognizable name, then you can easily identify the
system. Therefore, the TCP/IP protocols (and the Solaris OS) require both
the IP address and the host name to uniquely identify a system. </para><para>From a TCP/IP perspective, a network is a set of named entities. A host
is an entity with a name. A router is an entity with a name. The network is
an entity with a name. A group or department in which the network is installed
can also be given a name, as can a division, a region, or a company. In theory,
the hierarchy of names that can be used to identify a network has virtually
no limit. The domain name identifies a <emphasis>domain</emphasis>.</para><sect2 id="ipplan-27"><title>Administering Host Names</title><para>Many sites let users pick host names for their machines. Servers
also require at least one host name, which is associated with the IP address
of its primary network interface. </para><para>As a system administrator, you must ensure that each host name in your
domain is unique. In other words, no two machines on your network can both
have the name &#8220;fred.&#8221; However, the machine &#8220;fred&#8221;
might have multiple IP addresses. </para><para>When planning your network, make a list of IP addresses and their associated
host names for easy access during the setup process. The list can help you
verify that all host names are unique.</para>
</sect2><sect2 id="ipplan-28"><title>Selecting a Name Service and Directory Service</title><para>The Solaris OS enables you to use three types of name services:
local files, NIS, and DNS. Name services maintain critical information about
the machines on a network, such as the host names, IP addresses, Ethernet
addresses, and so forth. The Solaris OS also gives you the option of using
the LDAP directory service in addition to or instead of a name service. For
an introduction to name services on Solaris, refer to <olink targetdoc="sysadv5" targetptr="intro-1" remap="external">Part&#160;I, <citetitle remap="chapter">About Naming and Directory Services,</citetitle> in <citetitle remap="book">System Administration Guide: Naming and Directory Services (DNS, NIS, and LDAP)</citetitle></olink>.</para><sect3 id="ipplan-29"><title>Network Databases</title><para>When you install the operating system, you supply the host name
and IP address of your server, clients, or standalone system as part of the
procedure. The Solaris installation program adds this information into the <filename>hosts</filename> . This database is part of a set of network
databases that contain information necessary for TCP/IP operation on your
network. The name service that you select for your network reads these databases. </para><para>The configuration of the network databases is critical. Therefore, you
need to decide which name service to use as part of the network planning process.
Moreover, the decision to use name services also affects whether you organize
your network into an administrative domain. <olink targetptr="ipconfig-42" remap="internal">Network
Databases and the nsswitch.conf File</olink> has detailed information on the
set of network databases.</para>
</sect3><sect3 id="ipplan-30"><title>Using NIS or DNS as the Name Service</title><para>The NIS and DNS name services maintain network databases on several
servers on the network.  <olink targetdoc="sysadv5" remap="external"><citetitle remap="book">System Administration Guide: Naming and Directory Services (DNS, NIS, and LDAP)</citetitle></olink> describes
these name services and explains how to configure the databases. In addition,
the guide explain the &#8220;namespace&#8221; and &#8220;administrative domain&#8221;
concepts in detail. </para>
</sect3><sect3 id="ipplan-31"><title>Using Local Files as the Name Service</title><para>If you do not implement NIS, LDAP, or DNS, the network uses <emphasis>local files</emphasis> to provide the name service. The term &#8220;local
files&#8221; refers to the series of files in the <filename>/etc</filename> directory
that the network databases use. The procedures in this book assume you are
using local files for your name service, unless otherwise indicated. </para><note><para>If you decide to use local files as the name service for your
network, you can set up another name service at a later date.</para>
</note>
</sect3><sect3 id="ipplan-32"><title>Domain Names</title><para>Many networks organize their hosts and routers into a hierarchy
of administrative domains. If you are using the NIS or DNS name service, you
must select a domain name for your organization that is unique worldwide.
To ensure that your domain name is unique, you should register the domain
name with the InterNIC. If you plan to use DNS, you also need to register
your domain name with the InterNIC. </para><para>The domain name structure is hierarchical. A new domain typically is
located below an existing, related domain. For example, the domain name for
a subsidiary company can be located below the domain of the parent company.
If the domain name has no other relationship, an organization can place its
domain name directly under one of the existing top-level domains. </para><para>The following are a few examples of top-level domains: </para><itemizedlist><listitem><para><filename>.com</filename> &#8211; Commercial companies (international

</sect3><sect3 id="ipplan-33"><title>Administrative Subdivisions</title><para>The question of administrative subdivisions deals with matters
of size and control. The more hosts and servers that you have in a network,
the more complex your management task. You might want to handle such situations
by setting up additional administrative divisions. Add networks of a particular
class. Divide existing networks into subnets. The decision about setting up
administrative subdivisions for your network is determined by the following
factors: </para><itemizedlist><listitem><para><emphasis role="strong">How large is the network?</emphasis></para><para>A single administrative division can handle a single network of several
hundred hosts, all in the same physical location and requiring the same administrative
services. However, sometimes you should establish several administrative subdivisions.
Subdivisions are particularly useful if you have a small network with subnets
and the network is scattered over an extensive geographical area.</para>

</itemizedlist><itemizedlist><listitem><para><emphasis role="strong">Do users on the network have similar
needs?</emphasis></para><para>For example, you might have a network that is confined to a single
building and supports a relatively small number of machines. These machines
are divided among a number of subnetworks. Each subnetwork supports groups
of users with different needs. In this example, you might use an administrative
subdivision for each subnet.</para>
