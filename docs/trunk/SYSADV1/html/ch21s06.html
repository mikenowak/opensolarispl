<p>The following terms are used throughout the patch management chapters.</p>
<div class="glosslist"><dl><dt><a name="glossary_analyze"></a>analyze</dt><dd><p>To check a system to determine the list of patches that are

by the patch.</p></dd><dt><a name="glossary_caching"></a>caching</dt><dd><p>The ability of a server in a chain of patch servers to store
a patch that has been downloaded to it from another server.</p></dd><dt><a name="glossary_dependency"></a>dependency</dt><dd><p>See <span class="olink">
<span class="strong"><strong>patch dependency</strong></span>
</span>.</p></dd><dt><a name="glossary_digital_signature"></a>digital signature</dt><dd><p>An electronic signature that can be used to ensure that a
document has not been modified since the signature was applied.</p></dd><dt><a name="glossary_download"></a>download</dt><dd><p>To copy one or more patches from a source of patches, such
as the Sun patch server, to the system where the patches are to be applied.</p></dd><dt><a name="glossary_download_directory"></a>download directory</dt><dd><p>Directory in which patches are stored when they are downloaded
from the patch source. This is also the directory from which patches are applied.
The default location is <code class="filename">/var/sadm/spool</code>.</p></dd><dt><a name="glossary_keystore"></a>keystore</dt><dd><p>A repository of certificates and keys that is queried when
you attempt to apply a signed patch.</p></dd><dt><a name="glossary_local_mode"></a>local mode</dt><dd><p>A mode available for the <span><strong class="command">smpatch</strong></span> command,
which can only be run on the local system. This mode can be used to apply
patches while the system is in single-user mode or in multiuser mode.</p></dd><dt><a name="glossary_nonstandard_patch"></a>nonstandard patch</dt><dd><p>A patch that is associated with the <code class="literal">interactive</code> property,
with one or more of the <code class="literal">rebootafter</code>, <code class="literal">rebootimmediate</code>, <code class="literal">reconfigafter</code>, <code class="literal">reconfigimmediate</code>, and <code class="literal">singleuser</code> properties, or a patch that cannot be applied by running the usual
patch management tools.</p></dd><dt><a name="glossary_order"></a>order</dt><dd><p>To sort a set of patches in an order suitable for applying
patches.</p></dd><dt><a name="glossary_package"></a>package</dt><dd><p>The form in which software products are delivered for installation
on a system. The package contains a collection of files and directories in
a defined format.</p></dd><dt><a name="glossary_patch"></a>patch</dt><dd><p>An update to software that corrects an existing problem or
that introduces a feature.</p></dd><dt><a name="glossary_patch_analysis"></a>patch analysis</dt><dd><p>A method of checking a system to determine which patches are
appropriate for the system.</p></dd><dt><a name="glossary_patch_dependency"></a>patch dependency</dt><dd><p>An instance where a patch depends on the existence of another
patch on a system. A patch that depends on one or more patches can only be
applied to a system when those other patches have already been applied.</p></dd><dt><a name="glossary_patch_id"></a>patch ID</dt><dd><p>A unique alphanumeric string, with the patch base code first,
a hyphen, and a number that represents the patch revision number.</p></dd><dt><a name="glossary_patch_incompatibility"></a>patch incompatibility</dt><dd><p>A rare situation where two patches cannot be on the same system.
Each patch in the relationship is incompatible with the other. If you want
to apply a patch that is incompatible with a patch already on the system,
you must first remove the patch that is already on the system. Then, you can
apply the new patch.</p></dd><dt><a name="glossary_patch_list"></a>patch list</dt><dd><p>A file that contains a list of patches, one patch ID per line.
Such a list can be used to perform patch operations. The list can be generated
based on the analysis of a system or on user input.</p><p>Each line
in a patch list has two columns. The first column is the patch ID, and the
second column is a synopsis of that patch.</p></dd><dt><a name="glossary_patch_management_process"></a>patch management
process</dt><dd><p>A process that involves analyzing a system to determine the
appropriate patches, downloading the patches to that system, and applying
the patches. Another part of the patch management process is the optional
removal of patches.</p></dd><dt><a name="glossary_patch_obsolescence"></a>patch obsolescence</dt><dd><p>An instance where a patch replaces another patch, even if
it has not already been applied to a system. A patch that obsoletes one or
more patches replaces those patches entirely and does not require that the
obsolete patches be applied before the replacement patch is applied.</p></dd><dt><a name="glossary_patchpro"></a>PatchPro</dt><dd><p>A product developed by Sun Network Storage to provide automated
patch management technology, which is used by Sun Patch Manager.</p></dd><dt><a name="glossary_patch_server"></a>patch server</dt><dd><p>A source of Solaris patches that can be used by your systems
to perform patch analyses and from which to obtain the appropriate patches. </p></dd><dt><a name="glossary_patch_policy"></a>policy for applying patches</dt><dd><p>A user-configurable policy that specifies the types of patches
that can be applied during an update of your system.</p></dd><dt><a name="glossary_remote_mode"></a>remote mode</dt><dd><p>A mode available for the <span><strong class="command">smpatch</strong></span> command,
which can be run on a local system to update another system with patches.
This mode can only be used while the system is in multiuser mode.</p></dd><dt><a name="glossary_resolve"></a>resolve</dt><dd><p>To determine the patch dependencies required for a list of
patches. Each patch in the list is checked to determine whether any other
patches must be added to the list. If any patches are required, they are added
to the ordered patch list.</p></dd><dt><a name="glossary_signed_patch"></a>signed patch</dt><dd><p>A patch that is signed with a valid digital signature. A signed
patch offers greater security than an unsigned patch. The digital signature
of the patch can be verified before the patch is applied to your system. A
valid digital signature ensures that the signed patch has not been modified
since the signature was applied. Signed patches are stored in Java Archive
(JAR) format files.</p></dd><dt><a name="glossary_standard_patch"></a>standard patch</dt><dd><p>A patch that can be applied to a Solaris system that is running
in multiuser mode without having to reboot. Such a patch is associated with
the <code class="literal">standard</code> patch property.</p></dd><dt><a name="glossary_sun_alert"></a>Sun Alert</dt><dd><p>A notification to customers of a known product issue that
might negatively impact customers' computing environments or productivity.
A problem that warrants a Sun Alert notification meets the criteria for issues
that are related to at least one of these concerns: availability, security,
and data loss.</p></dd><dt><a name="glossary_sunsolve"></a>SunSolve Online</dt><dd><p>The Sun Microsystems web site that provides access to patch
data. Patch Manager uses the data to perform patch analyses of your systems.
See <a href="http://sunsolve.sun.com" target="_top">
</a>.</p></dd><dt><a name="glossary_unsigned_patch"></a>unsigned patch</dt><dd><p>A patch that is not signed with a digital signature.</p></dd><dt><a name="glossary_update"></a>update</dt><dd><p>(n.)  A change to software that you apply that corrects an
existing problem or that introduces a feature.</p><p>(v.) To perform
the steps that are necessary to apply updates to a system. The system is analyzed,
and the updates are downloaded and then applied. Also called patch.</p></dd><dt><a name="glossary_web_proxy"></a>web proxy</dt><dd><p>A system that is used to connect your system to the Internet.
Your system cannot connect directly to the Internet, but must use the web
proxy to establish the connection.</p></dd></dl></div>
